    "description": "This two-semester second-level writing course aims to guide students to (1) practice basic academic writing convention, (2) sharpen analytical essay writing skills, (3) enhance essay coherence and cohesion, and (4) develop a clear writing style. The course will familiarize students with proper academic language and convention to compose five-paragraph short essays on the following five modes of writing: argumentation, definition, causal analysis, process analysis, and comparison and contrast. In addition to the different analytical modes of writing, the course will introduce students to organizing and editing strategies to fine-tune their essay writing. On the one hand, students will learn how to apply principles of coherence and cohesion in their writing to maintain consistent claims and to offer logical transitions at the levels of ideas, sentences, and paragraphs. On the other hand, students will learn how to develop a clear writing style by avoiding common sentence errors and improving concision and specificity in word choice and sentence formation.",

A very good example is _The True Story of The Three Little Pigs_ (our main library has a copy of this book). In this semester, you will be guided to complete your story step by step. Different worksheets will be provided to help you brainstorm ideas and develop your story.\n\nTo add visual appeal to your story, you also need to find some images or draw illustrations (simple illustrations are fine!) for every page in your storybook (including the front cover). Moreover, you need to present your story page by page in a portfolio (as if it is a “real” book). In Week 18, a book reading club will take place for everyone to showcase his/her story to the class.\n\n**3\\. Classroom Policies:**\n\n(1) Class attendance is a fundamental requirement that will be strictly enforced in this course. You are required to come to class every week. Absence from **each class period** will result in a 2-point deduction from your attendance/participation score (except for a valid excuse approved by the instructor). Arriving late to class or leaving early will also count as an absence. Your participation will also be scored based on how much you contribute to discussions.\n\n(2) Please participate in group discussions (e.g., group work, peer review, etc.) in English.\n\n(3) Please note that you are required to submit any of your assignments (including reports and projects) before it is due. Late assignments will be marked down by **30%**. Once they are two or more days late, they will NOT be accepted under any circumstances. \n\n(4) Dishonesty: Academic dishonesty is a misconduct that occurs in academic exercises. It involves plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, etc. You will be penalized for academic dishonesty on any tests, assignments and exercises.\n\n**4\\.
