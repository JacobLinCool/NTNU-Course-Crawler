    "syllabus": "**Course Description**\n\nThis course is structured to provide you some basic constructs and theories in assessing English as a foreign language (EFL). The class will first learn to differentiate among evaluation, assessment, and testing. Then different purposes, and different types, of language assessment will discussed. A lot of time will be devoted to the techniques and principles in constructing test items for English vocabulary, grammar, listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Hands-on activity will be provided in and outside the class. Authentic test papers, including large-scale renowned tests, school monthly tests, and teacher-made tests, will be used as the sample for discussion in evaluating the quality of individual test items and the test papers. Students may choose to take a mid-term exam, or to write a term paper instead. At the end course, students need to work in groups of four producing a set of test papers on reading, listening, speaking, and writing. This group projects need to be presented orally in class for feedback, and submitted in written afterwards.\n\n**Course Objectives**\n\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to\n\n1.  understand basic constructs and principles in foreign language testing and assessment\n2.  diagnose the problems in EFL test items on vocabulary, grammar, listening, speaking, reading, and writing;\n3.  evaluate the quality of test papers and assessment tasks\n4.  construct valid, practical and reliable EFL tests and develop assessment tasks for the use in high schools English class;\n\n*   **Tentative Schedule:**\n\n**Week**\n\n**Topic**\n\n\\# 1 (9/12)\n\nIntroduction\n\n\\# 2 (9/19)\n\nChap. 1\n\nChap. 2\n\nTeaching and testing\n\nTesting as problem solving\n\n\\# 3 (9/26)\n\nChap. 3\n\nChap. 4\n\nKinds of test and testing\n\nValidity\n\n\\# 4 (10/3)\n\nChap. 5\n\nReliability\n\n\\# 5 (10/10)\n\nChap. 6\n\nChap. 7\n\nAchieving beneficial backwash\n\nStages of test construction\n\n\\# 6 (10/17)\n\nHandout;\n\nChap.l3 (Bailey)\n\nMultiple approaches to language assessment (by Brian)\n\nAlternative assessments: performance tests & portfolios\n\n\\# 7 (10/24)\n\nChap. 8\n\nCommon test techniques\n\n\\# 8 (10/31)\n\n![](file:///C:/Users/BRIANY~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.png)\n\n**Midterm Exam**\n\n**(You can choose to write a term paper instead)**\n\n\\# 9 (11/7)\n\nChap. 13\n\nChap. 14\n\nTesting grammar and vocabulary\n\nTesting overall ability\n\n\\# 10 (11/14)\n\nChap. 11\n\n(Weir, 4.1)\n\nTesting Reading\n\nCEEC Checklist for test construction\n\nDiscussion on DRET paper\n\n\\# 11 (11/21)\n\nHandouts\n\n(GEPT; DRET)\n\nTesting grammar, vocabulary and reading  (hands-on activity & discussion: one cloze and one reading comprehension)\n\n\\# 12 (11/28)\n\nChap. 12\n\n(Weir, 4.2)\n\nTesting listening\n\nTesting listening (hands-on activity & discussion)\n\n\\# 13 (12/5)\n\nChap. 10\n\n(Weir, 4.2)\n\nTesting oral ability\n\nTesting oral ability (hands-on activity & discussion)\n\n\\# 14 (12/12)\n\nChap. 9\n\nTesting writing (hands-on activity & discussion)\n\n\\# 15 (12/19)\n\nHandout\n\nTest design of Basic Competence Test\n\n(國中會考測驗英語科命題方向探討)\n\n**Deadline: hard copy of your draft tests for Dr. Yeh**\n\n**S****end files of your draft tests to all classmates**\n\n\\# 16 (12/28)\n\nHandouts (GEPT; DRET Exams)\n\n\\# 17 (1/2)\n\nHandout\n\nTesting of Thinking Skills (by Brian Yeh)\n\n\\# 18 (1/9)\n\n![](file:///C:/Users/BRIANY~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.png)\n\nPresentation of testing projects",
