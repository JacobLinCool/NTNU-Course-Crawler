    "description": "The goal of the course is three-fold: to elevate students’ confidence and motivation to participate in English conversation, to broaden their knowledge pertaining to English conversation, and to enhance their skills in conducting English conversation. Through adjusting one’s attitude toward his/her role as an English interlocutor and acquiring communication strategies and basic understanding of discourse features of English conversation, students are expected to be able to conduct, i.e., beginning, sustaining, and ending, an English conversation in a culturally appropriate fashion and in a light-hearted manner. The class is conducted primarily through pair or group conversation of class materials and mini exercises to cultivate and polish learners’ conversation management skills.",

    "syllabus": "**Objectives**: The goal of this course is to enhance students’ English speaking competence by **broadening their scope** of English conversation and **enhancing their communication skills in real-life situations**. At the same time, it will try to **build confidence** and **motivate** them to **actively participate in English conversation**. In order to do so, there is a **four-pronged approach** to the course this semester:\n\n1.  Firstly, the **course textbook** presents natural language in authentic contexts, and helps **develop conversation management strategies** in order to significantly improve both fluency and confidence.\n2.  Secondly, there will also be various **supplementary materials**. These will vary over a range of areas and at appropriate times, so that students can to familiarize themselves with topical language spoken in various popular settings.\n3.  Thirdly, over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a **task-based project**, in which task groups, of no more than 4 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are **of interest to them**, and then **present their work** to the class **via film, audio, performance or presentation**. Examples include short films (comedy, drama, horror), radio shows (news, weather, interviews, ads), plays (skits, drama, musicals), shows (music, magic, games), or interesting topical presentations on topics that are of serious interest to themselves.\n4.  Finally, over the course of the second-half of the semester, there will be an emphasis on **intellectual discussion.** Learning discussion helps students **develop** their **reasoning** and **communication skills** thereby encouraging **collaborative thinking** while **attuning** students to a **multiplicity of viewpoints and perspectives**.
