Therefore, language is meaningful and grammar is motivated. Under this usage-based view of grammar, this course aims to examine English grammar from a functional perspective, and to further bridge the gap between theory and practice in study of grammar. Course content includes:\n\n1.  critical review of traditional accounts of English grammar\n2.  brief introduction to basic principles in functional grammar (e.g. prototype, iconicity, and markedness)\n3.  re-examination of some grammar patterns in English (e.g. word classification, basic sentence patterns, tense & aspect, reference &definiteness, voice & de-transitivization, contrastive focus constructions, etc.)\n4.  hands-on tutorials on how to use corpus-based tools for usage-based analyses of grammar\n\nCourse requirements include class participation, (take-home) assignments and a final exam. For each week, the first half of the course will be held mainly in a lecture-based format, with critical questions provided for in-class discussions and interactions. The second half of the course will include a tutorial session on how to utilize existing corpus-based tools to analyze the meanings and functions of the target grammatical structures. Throughout the semester, relevant linguistic resources, toolkits, and databases will be introduced for students to develop their digital competence in exploring the functions behind linguistic structures.\n\nThis course is open to all those who are interested in the structure of the English language and hope to better their command in the pragmatic use of the language. This course has no specific prerequisites and welcomes students from other disciplines.\n\nReadings\n========\n\n1.  Givon, Talmy. 1993. _English Grammar (I & II)_. John Benjamins.\n2.
