The selected literary works are studied in terms of basic elements such as plot, setting, point of view, theme, style and tone, symbolism and also in terms of critical concepts and approaches so as to enhance students’ meaningful reading of literature and to heighten their sensibility and appreciation of aesthetic, social, cultural, ethical, and philosophical dimensions of literary expressions.",

We will consider the basic elements of literature, such as plot and setting, as well as the broader figurative meanings of literature. Students will also learn how to write academic responses to literature.  \n  \n\n**Attendance, Participation, and Group Assignments**\n\nStudents are expected to regularly attend and contribute to class discussions. Group assignments will consist of written responses that you will complete with other students in class. We will have six group response assignments this semester (they are marked **GA** on the schedule below).\n\n**Midterm and Final Exams**\n\nThe midterm and final exams will be a combination of some short and one long written responses.  The short responses will be related to “basic elements” of literature (plot, setting, etc.). The long response will be just like the ones you do in the group assignments, but you will be asked to write on a passage from one of the stories that you did _not_ write about in groups.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nWeek 1, 9/14: Introduction and Syllabus Review; David Foster Wallace, “Everything is Green”\n\nWeek 2, 9/21: Elements of Fiction: “Plot” (82-89); Nathaniel Hawthorne, “The Birth-Mark” (290-302)\n\nWeek 3, 9/28: Flannery O’Connor, “A Good Man is Hard to Find” (422-433); How to Write a Response to Literature\n\nWeek 4, 10/5: Kate Chopin, “The Story of an Hour” (475-477); **GA**\n\nWeek 5, 10/12: John Updike, “A & P” (148-153); **GA**  \n\nWeek 6, 10/19: Elements of Fiction: “Narration and Point of View” (160-164); A.
