    "description": "This course, first of all, orients students into various representative modern fantasy writers (Sade, Hoffmann, Poe, Lovecraft, Wells, Kafka, Le Guin, Gibson, Oates and Gaiman) and its generic characteristics such as metamorphosis, existential and structural uncertainty, alternative spatio-temporal experiences, and so on. Psychoanalytic perspectives are introduced and, later, applied to textual analysis. Reading materials include five short stories and two novels, which cover various sub genres of fantasy (the Gothic, horror, the grotesque, and utopia) and are analytically, critically accessed by way of lectures and discussions with a view to not only psychological but also social and political aspects.",
