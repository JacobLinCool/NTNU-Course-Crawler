    "description": "This course will give an overview of the major features of English grammar. It will not cover all grammatical features in English, but rather aim at initiating independent thinking and research on the problematic areas of English grammar. You will become familiar with the intricacies of English grammar, particularly those that tend to be challenging to nonnative speakers. In this course you will learn to describe how English sentences are constructed and you will develop the skills necessary to analyze and explain English words, phrases and sentences, as well as learn the terminology to talk about them. In addition, you will learn about a corpus-based approach to studying vocabulary. Examining the use of words in natural contexts and different registers sheds light on our understanding of their true senses",
    "goals": [
        "understand how English grammar works and feel more confident about helping your peers and/or ESL students use English accurately, meaningfully, and appropriately",
        "identify and correct grammatical errors in spoken and written English and provide grammar explanations with commonly used terminology",
        "explain how a word is used appropriately and how related words are distinguished"
