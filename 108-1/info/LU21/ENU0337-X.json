The finished product of this course is a research proposal of your own with some initial result from a pilot study.\n\nAs we introduce basics of research methods in general, these methods should be applicable in academic studies as well as in your future workplace when research is needed for further development and improvement. In addition to learning how to carrying out a research project, more importantly, being familiar with the methods for doing research will also help you to think clearly and to be able to critically analyze the claims and arguments made by other people.\n\n**Main Textbook**\n\nWalliman, Nicholas.
