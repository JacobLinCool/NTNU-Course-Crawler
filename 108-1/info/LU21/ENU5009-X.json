    "syllabus": "English Reading & Writing  \n  \n  \n教學目標:  \nCourse description:  \nThis course is intended to integrate reading strategies and writing skills and thus to enable students to write coherent paragraphs. Reading materials on different topics are presented as models to familiarize students with basic elements in the composition of an article, such as vocabulary and idioms, sentence grammar and textual structures. Outside readings related to the textbook are also encouraged. After in-class discussion of the reading materials, paragraph writing practice will follow, focusing especially on how to write an appropriate topic sentence, how to support the topic sentence with examples, details, anecdotes, facts, etc. and how to develop ideas in a logical order. Summary writing is included to shorten the gap between reading and writing. Bi-weekly journal writing is also required so that students can practice writing regularly.  \n  \n  \n教材內容:  \nEnglish Reading and Writing  \nFall, 2010  \nClass Hours: Friday 10:10~12:00  \nInstructor: Huang, Wen-Chi  \nE-mail: glavinehuang@ntnu.edu.tw  \n  \n  \n  \nMeetings Topics  \n  \nweek 1 Orientation  \n  \nweek 2 Reading-Unit 1  \n  \nweek 3 Reading-Unit 2  \n  \nweek 4 Writing 1  \n  \nweek 5 Reading-Unit 3  \n  \nweek 6 TBA  \n  \nweek 7 Reading-Unit 4  \n  \nweek 8 Writing 2  \n  \nweek 9 Midterm Exam  \n  \nweek 10 Reading-Unit 6  \n  \nweek 11 Reading-Unit 7  \n  \nweek 12 Writing 3  \n  \nweek 13 Reading-Unit 8  \n  \nweek 14 Reading-Unit 9  \n  \nweek 15 Writing 4  \n  \nweek 16 Reading-Unit 12  \n  \nweek 17.18 Final Portfolio  \n  \n  \n方法評量:  \nGrading Policy:  \n1\\.
