    "description": "This course takes an ecological perspective on language and language acquisition, focusing on some of the learning mechanisms that might be shared by both first and second language learning. One such mechanism will be closely examined: statistical learning. Possibilities of re-activating this mechanism for second language learning will be discussed in the class.",
    "goals": [
        "Understand and appreciate the psychological perspective on language acquisition;",
        "Explore and understand the learning mechanisms that infants and adults are equipped with for learning languages, first or second;",
        "Develop a critical view of language learning theories;",
        "Be able to put the new theory to practice ;"
    ],
    "syllabus": "Students and I will walk through Leo van Lier’s 2004 book chapter by chapter and page by page, to ensure a full understanding of the ecology of language learning. There are nine chapters in the book. We will spend two weeks on a chapter. Students will write a highlight and summary after having gone through the chapter. Points for further thinking are also encouraged in the chapter summary.",
