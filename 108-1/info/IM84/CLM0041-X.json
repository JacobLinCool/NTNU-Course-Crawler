    "description": "How do people acquire, comprehend and acquire their first language and what learning mechanisms and psychological processes underlie these behaviors? We will explore the basic linguistic principles and theory, and their interaction with learning mechanisms and psychological processes in language acquisition, comprehension, and production. This course serves as both an introduction course to the field and review of major studies to more advanced issues in Psycholinguistics which function as a milestone to understand what psychological processes and learning mechanism that are common for both first language learners and second language learners and to understand what difference between native speakers and second language learners.",
    "goals": [
        "Understand how linguistic principles can be investigated in terms of psycholinguistic methodology and enlighten psycholinguistics.",
        "be able to specify what psycholinguistic factors affect language learning and acquisition.",
        "develop a research hypothesis on a particular effect of language acquisition, comprehension and production."
