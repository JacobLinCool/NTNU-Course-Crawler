More specifically, this course not only examines the information behavior as a whole, but also covers the breakdown of the process, including information needs assessment, information seeking, and information use. The learning objectives in this course are including: A. To understand the key concepts of Information retrieval and human information interaction. B. To learn the theories and methodologies of HII deeper and border. C. To know how to apply the theories and methodologies of HII in the real context. D. To develop expertise and first-hand experience in a particular specialized topic of HII.",
