    "description": "Global environmental challenges, such as climate change, require human responses on various scale-levels – ranging from the global to local. This course adopts a human geography perspective on studies in climate change. While we will particularly focus on climate change and cities, we will also pay attention to rural areas and development. Students interested in climate resilience, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and coupled social-environmental systems are especially encouraged to take this course.\n\nCities will be more and more vulnerable to the negative effects of global climate change. This is due to three main reasons: cities are immobile; cities are often located in low-elevated regions and deltas; and rapid and uncontrolled urbanization trends often pose significant challenges to urban and regional planners. Around 60 percent of people globally will live in urban areas by 2030. Especially secondary cities, urban settlements ranging in size between 10 per cent and 50 per cent of a nation’s largest city, are in dire need of developing strategies and policies which improve their climate resilience. On the one hand, climate change will increase rapid onset hazards, such as tropical storms, floods and cyclones. On the other hand, it will exacerbate slow onset hazards, such as drought, sea level rise, and changes in rainfall regimes and temperature Therefore, planners and scientists need to design a multitude of climate resilience planning strategies to respond to these diverse effects. At the same time, these planners and scientists are not working in a vacuum. They have to cooperate with local, national and international stakeholders. Climate resilience of rural hinterlands need to be taken into account as well. This to curb rural-to-urban migration flows. Hence, this course provides an holistic approach to climate resilience and sustainability. Not only will we discuss theoretical debates on climate resilience, and vulnerability, but this course also provides ample empirical evidence of both successful and unsuccessful planning strategies and challenges. While this course will primarily focus on Asia, we will also look at examples of other developed and developing countries. Furthermore, we will pay attention to Post-2015 sustainability agendas such as the New Urban Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals, and COP meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
