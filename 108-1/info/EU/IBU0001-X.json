    "description": "This course engages pre-service teachers to explore contemporary educational theories and IB education pedagogy. Course sessions introduce perspectives and approaches to develop school-aged students “inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people” and “active, compassionate and lifelong learners.” To ensure that pre-service teachers acquire both theoretical and practical sense of IB education, the course invites IB practitioners (experienced teachers) to share their experiences and engage pre-service teachers to critically reflect on related educational issues. The course instructor and the invited speakers also guide pre-service teachers to construct unit plans",
    "goals": [
        "Know IB programme models, standards, and the curriculum coherence.",
        "Demonstrate the competence in designing learning activities that are embedded with IB philosophy.",
        "Be able to communicate and collaborate with peers within different teacher communities.",
        "Appreciate how teaching and learning are done in IB schools and reflect to their own instruction.",
        "Construct several unit plans which allow students to inquire knowledge independently."
