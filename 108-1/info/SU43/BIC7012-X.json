    "description": "Phylogenetics explores how organisms, genes, and traits have evolved, and seeks to represent the history of life’s divergence through the use of phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetics has contributed to a wide variety of research particularly in the fields of systematics, biogeography (phylogeography), adaptive evolution and community structure. Lectures will emphasize the logical basis and computational principles of various tree-building algorithms and associated methods of hypothesis testing, as well as application of next-generation sequencing data in phylogenetic tree building. In general, this course will focus on the use, interpretation and methods of reconstructing evolutionary trees.",
