In the first half of the course, we will read tragedies by the three Greek playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In the second half of the course, we will read several plays that have been influenced either directly or indirectly by Greek tragedy. In particular, we will read plays written by Seneca, Shakespeare, Racine, Cao Yu, and Arthur Miller.",
