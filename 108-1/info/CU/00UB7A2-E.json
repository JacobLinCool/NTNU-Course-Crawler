    "syllabus": "_**O**_**bjectives:** This course is designed to support college freshmen in their use of **English language in academic context** and to improve their **reading proficiency and vocabulary knowledge** through intensive and extensive reading and reading skill/strategy training. In addition to reading and vocabulary abilities, this class also aims to build up students’ proficiency in the other **three main language skills**—**writing, listening, and speaking**—through activities that integrate the four language skills. The objectives of this class include developing students’ (1) **effective English reading skills**, (2) **improved fluency** in expressing ideas **in oral and written forms in English**, and (3) **autonomous self-study skills** using technologies such as computers and internet. In order to do so, there a four-pronged approach to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** the **course textbook and online practice website** emphasize vocabulary learning and building in order to provide students the structure and tools to acquire new words. There is also a purposefully structured skills and strategies program to propel language learning and create independent learners. Furthermore, the textbook helps improve reading proficiency and develop practical critical thinking.\n\n**2) Secondly,** over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake **one major task-based project**, in which task groups, of no more than 4 students per group, are asked to investigate areas and topics that are of interest to them, and then present their work to the class via film, audio, performance or presentation. Examples include short films (comedy, drama, horror), radio shows (news, weather, interviews, ads), plays (skits, drama, musicals), shows (music, magic, games).\n\n**3) Thirdly,** You must visit **Self-Access Room** (Main campus 樸101) **and/or English Chat Room** (Gongguan Library A107 or Main Campus 樸102) as much as you can. You are expected to visit them for at least 10 hours in total this semester. Furthermore, students should practice their English every chance they get, e.g. **Lexile reading and autonomous learning.** **Record these experiences in your notebook for grading!**\n\n**4) Finally**, students will be asked to do a **writing workshop** in the second half of the course, by writing up short critical essays based on class work\n\n.\n\n**N.B:** All elements to the course will be evaluated and assessed for the final grade. \n\n**Textbook:** Daise, D., Norloff, C., & Carne, P.
