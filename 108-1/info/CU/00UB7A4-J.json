    "syllabus": "   **ENGLISH(I) Autumn 2019**\n\nInstructor: Shiang, Ruei-Fang\n\nE-mail: joyceshiang@ntnu.edu.tw\n\n **Course Description**\n\nThis course aims to develop student’s English proficiency regarding all four language skills. Students are expected to increase their reading and writing literacy along with listening comprehension and communication competence through a variety of in-class and out-of-class activities.\n\n**Textbook**\n\n**School-Assigned:**\n\n1.  Macintyre, Paul & Bohlke, David.  (2015).  _Reading Explorer: Book 2 (Second Edition)._  National Geographic Learning.\n2.  Lexile Graded Reader\n\n**_Optional, Discipline-related_**:\n\nonline resources\n\n**A) Requirements and Rules**\n\n1.  **Punctual attendance**, **lesson preparation** and **active participation** are required. Participation also includes teamwork and group discussion.\n2.  All absences will be classified as excused or unexcused.\n3.  Absences for the following reasons will be _excused_ if there is timely verification (within 1 week) of such reasons provided to the instructor:\n4.  Illness or medical emergency\n5.  Family emergencies\n6.  Pre-arranged medical appointments.\n7.  Pre-arranged school-sponsored activities, such as field trips.\n8.  A Notification of Absence Form has to be submitted online (學生請假系統) within 1 week. Verification document (hard-copy) should also be handed in to the instructor within 1 week. Late submission will not be accepted.\n9.  Students who are more than 30 minutes late to class will be considered absent.\n10.  Students will fail this course if there are more than 3 unexcused absences.\n11.  Students will fail this course if they miss more than 5 meetings the whole semester.\n\n**B) Plagiarism and cheating on quizzes or exams** is absolutely forbidden. If someone is found cheating on an exam, he/she will fail that exam.\n\n**C) Textbook** is a must. Violation of this rule will cost you 2 points (out of your final score) each time.\n\n**D)** You cannot use your laptop or smart phone in class without the teacher’s permission. Violation of this rule will cost you 2 points each time.\n\n**E)**\n\nBefore every meeting, you must preview the reading. Look up the words that you don’t know in the dictionary and write down their meanings. Then read the paragraphs out loud. Try to get the main idea of each paragraph. I’ll check whether you have done all the preview tasks in class. Those who fail to do what is required will lose one point each time.\n\n**F)**\n\nThe whole class will be divided into 6 groups. Each group picks one person who is competent and responsible to be their leader. In every meeting, the leader checks his group members’ textbooks for me to see if each of them has looked up the new words in the dictionary and written their meanings on the book. Then he goes over the text to see if each one understands everything. After that, some students will be randomly called to read aloud or translate the text and answer the comprehension questions. If they cannot do the task well, they’ll get some assignment to do after class. Then some follow-up questions will be raised for further discussion. Each discussion session will last 20 minutes. Exchange your opinions within your group and contribute your ideas. \n\n**G)** \n\nThis semester you have to turn in a written reflection on or a special assignment related to the assigned Lexile reading. Print them out on an A4 paper and submit them to me as scheduled.\n\n**H)**\n\nA very special and trendy project will be held in this semester. You can use multimedia and all kinds of resources (apps, props, costumes, photos, etc.) to make your presentation interesting to the audience. It must be done in English and last at least 4 minutes. More details about this trendy project will be given in class.\n\n**I)**\n\nThis semester we won’t have paper tests. Instead, we’ll have lots of oral practices. Each time you do the practice which is relevant to the topics we are studying, one point is given and taken as classroom participation \n\n**J)**\n\nIn order to improve your extensive reading skills and discussion skills, one Lexile book will be assigned as an outside reading for you to practice discussing in Week 14. Before the event, the teacher will briefly introduce the essence of quality talk and the most frequently used 6 types of questions. Each student must try to ask as many questions as possible, proving that they really understand how to ask questions in order to elicit important information and stimulate further thoughts. They write down their questions on a paper before coming to class. In class, they take turns asking their group members the questions. While doing the task, they work together, thinking about which questions are important and inspiring enough to be included. After that, they hand in a paper with all the questions fitting the 6 categories and their answers on it. This assignment is due in Week 15 and constitutes 5 points. Then each student either writes down his/her thought or complete a special assignment about the book on an A4 paper and submit it to me in Week 15 too. This will constitute another 5 points.\n\n**K)**\n\nAt the end of the term, the leader rates his/her group members’ degree of engagement in the discussion and their overall contribution on a 0–5 scale. In addition, in order to push the students to enlarge their word bank, vocabulary tests will be held to see how many important words the students have learned. Moreover, there will be a reading-aloud test in order to push the students to open their mouths and read English out loud. Every student will be required to read aloud a paragraph chosen from the readings in the textbook. Their performance in the test will constitute 5 points.\n\n**L)**\n\n**Check Course Group Page and email frequently**\n\nI assume that you check your email and the course site frequently. It’s your responsibility to make sure you register with the correct email address on course group page . **Not receiving a notice is NOT an excuse for any late submission. Late submission will be penalized 10% per day.** \n\n**Grading Policies**\n\nAttendance 15%\n\nTrendy Project  10%\n\nGroup Presentation 10%\n\nReflection/Special Assignment on the Lexile Reading   5%\n\nQuestions for the Outside Reading and Their Answers  5%\n\nReading Aloud 10%\n\nPeer Evaluation 5%\n\nClassroom Participation/ Oral Practice/Vocabulary Test  40%\n\n**Bonus Points (for those who can’t get 60 points in the Final Exam)**\n\n1.

Extra points will be given if you participate in activities that help improve your English ability, such as Spelling Bee, Reading Aloud Competition, 3-minute presentations competition, E-book competition, listening to English talks, i-read or language exchange, etc. How many points you’ll get depends on the length of time and efforts you spend on them.\n3.
