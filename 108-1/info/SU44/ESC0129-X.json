    "description": "This course will be an introduction to the chemical processes that influence the solid Earth system. The application of chemistry to rocks offers important insight into igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary processes such as the differentiation of the Earth, thermodynamics, mineral formation and stability and the formation of mineral deposits. Further topics will include the use of radiogenic and stable isotopes in geochronology, the carbon cycle and life on Earth. The students will explore through a series of lectures and laboratory assignments novel methods which can help to understand the Earth’s natural environment",
