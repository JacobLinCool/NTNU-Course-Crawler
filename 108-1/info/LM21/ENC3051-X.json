    "description": "In this course, students will learn to design and develop writing materials for teaching and learning. The design will be informed by strands of theories, including language learning theories, learning theories, and linguistic theories, respectively serving pedagogical design, interface design and writing material development. We will first identify relevant variables/concepts from important language learning and learning sciences research to inform design. Students will be given opportunities to test their understanding by evaluating relevant designs available on the web. Next, we will introduce a linguistic framework and learn about how to conduct discourse analysis, which can be used to develop reading and writing materials. \n     Students will engage in discussions, actual doing/practicing, critiquing, and presentations. The final part of the class will be held in the form of workshops, where students will be involved in developing their designs, subjecting them to feedback and revisions, which will eventually lead to a final design prototype. \n     Students will obtain experience as a language learning/educational content developer. This class also serves an extension to designing reading materials.",
