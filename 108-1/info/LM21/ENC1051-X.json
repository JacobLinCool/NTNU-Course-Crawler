    "syllabus": "  \n\n**_Course description_**\n\n**The genre of life writing has become increasingly popular, complex and sophisticated over the past thirty years. It has become multi-disciplinary, incorporating multiple media and it also includes a broader range of contributors. Increasingly, therefore, life writing engages with social and political concerns, not only as subject matter but also as matters of style, narrative, and presentation.** Focusing on 20th and 21st century texts, the course investigates the changing paradigms of the genre, the intersection of life-writing with other genres, its new media, and current social, political or affective potentialities. The course is also meant to familiarize students with important theoretical debates relevant for the history of the genre.\n\n**_Course requirements_**\n\nThe course is structured as a series of lecture-seminars, with an introductory talk followed by student presentations and class discussion, in which all students are expected to take part. Students are expected to be familiar with the required readings _prior to_ the seminar, post comments on moodle, prepare oral presentations, focusing on a discussion theme for that week. One oral presentation will be developed into a 3000-4000 word essay in MLA citation style.\n\nActive participation in class discussions, moodle grade value: 40% Final paper 60%.\n\n**_Academic Dishonesty_**\n\nAcademic dishonesty is defined as but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, misrepresenting one’s work, and forging documentation. Academic dishonesty is a serious matter. I am savvy and vigilant in detecting students who use unattributed sources, citing references without indicating the sources or “collaborate” with fellow students during exams. Any student who plagiarizes or cheats will fail the course.\n\n  \n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Contents**\n\n1.     \n\n2.           \n\n02/20\n\n02/27\n\nIntroduction\n\nMake-up holiday, no class.\n\n3.     \n\n03/06\n\nBeginnings, key concepts, definitions, debates\n\n4.     \n\n03/13\n\nLife Writing and Race\n\n5.     \n\n03/20\n\nAutobiography and Fiction\n\n6.     \n\n03/27\n\nAutobiography and Fiction\n\n7.     \n\n04/03\n\n_Spring break, no class._\n\n8.     \n\n04/10\n\nVisual Lives.
