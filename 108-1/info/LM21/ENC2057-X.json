    "description": "This is an advanced statistics course for graduate students in social sciences. Students are required to complete a fundamental statistics course and a relevant programming course (capable of using R) prior to enrolling this course. We will cover the dimension reduction techniques, regression, classification, and resampling methods. Hands-on programming practice with R will be given in class. Students should bring their own laptops for the practical sessions.",
