    "description": "This course will examine three novels that defamiliarize the present (in this case, the late Victorian period, although of course that could extend to our own time) by imagining the alternative perspectives of completely different cultures, dimensions, and times. To better understand the historical emergence and theoretical implications of these novels, we will also read excerpts from earlier textual influences, as well as more recent scholarship and philosophy. Throughout the course, we will consider the function of speculative fiction, examine the relationship between science and literature, and strengthen our academic writing skills.",

Therefore, I expect students to come to class having already read the assigned texts. Each week, everyone should bring at least one question to pose about the reading, which will help facilitate our discussions. In addition, students will be assigned to give brief “presentations.” When it’s your presentation week, you will begin our discussion of that week’s reading: identify an important passage(s), analyze it, relate it to other texts or themes we’ve discussed, and/or pose questions about it."
