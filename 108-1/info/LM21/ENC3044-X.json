    "description": "Background:\nThe recent cognitive age views comprehension and production of written texts as intra-personal re/construction of meanings. Yet, the meaning making act of reading and writing depends on a cognitive reservoir that goes beyond personal. The cognitive resources within individuals that are brought to interplay with texts are laden with social, cultural, historical and political ideation and ideology. Besides, the context of reading and writing tasks also has its social, cultural and educational significance as conceptualized by readers/writers. These issues become even more complex in the context of reading and writing in a foreign language, where different cultural conceptions are in contact for negotiation. EFL reading/writing come in such a scenario. The understanding of cultural process and representation in written communication will help EFL educators in designing materials/methods and EFL researchers in interpreting their findings. \nGoal:\nThis course is thus designed to enhance the understanding of cross-cultural written communication between Chinese and English and its impacts on EFL readers/writers. Theoretical constructs in contrastive rhetoric, reading and writing will be introduced, followed by empirical studies that examine how cultural knowledge and context transact in the reading/writing process and how texts are modeled in the reader’s/writer’s mind. Special emphasis will be placed on the context of EFL reading and writing. This course will be of interest to anyone who wants to learn about the cultural conception in EFL reading and writing – those who plan to do research on reading/writing, those who want to learn how to read the research, and those who want some insight for teaching students reading/writing.",

    "syllabus": "I.  Background:\n\nThe recent socio-cognitive age views comprehension and production of written texts as going beyond intra-personal re/construction of meanings. The cognitive resources within individuals are brought to interplay with texts that are laden with social, cultural, historical, and political ideation and ideology. In addition, the context of reading and writing tasks also has its social, cultural and educational significance as conceptualized by readers/writers. These issues become even more complex in the context of reading and reading-to-write in a foreign language, where different cultural conceptions are in contact for negotiation. The understanding of the reading-to-write process and outcome might help EFL teachers in designing materials/methods and EFL researchers in interpreting their findings. This course thus will be of interest to anyone who wants to learn about the relationship between readers, writers, and texts in EFL context – those who want to learn how to read the research, those who plan to do research on reading/writing, and those who want to gain some insight for teaching students reading/writing.\n\n II.  Content:\n\n    This seminar will examine reading and writing connections in terms of various inter-related factors – social-cultural, psycho-linguistic, as well as rhetorical – that affect the process and outcome of reading-to-write. We will first look into theoretical constructs in reading, reading-to-write, and inter-cultural rhetoric, followed by empirical studies that examine how knowledge and context transact in the reading-to-write process, and how texts are represented in the reader’s/writer’s mind. Special emphasis will be placed on the context of EFL reading and writing to examine inter-cultural written communication between Chinese and English.\n\nII.      Topics covered:\n\nA.    Theoretical foundations: theories on reading, theories on reading-to-write, and theories on inter-cultural rhetoric.\n\nB.   Descriptive studies: multiple perspectives of cultural texts – individual, educational, historical, and socio-cultural.\n\nC.   Empirical studies: issues on contexts, tasks, texts, reader-writer awareness, stance, voice, and strategies in the reading-to-write process and outcome.\n\nIII.        Texts:\n\nA series of articles are available at the beginning of the semester. \n\nIV.    Assignments: Aside from classroom presentation of synopsis of and response to  assigned reading, students are required to turn in\n\nA. Response Paper: The short paper (2-3 pages) is written in response to two or three papers, discussed in class, that center on one argument. In this response paper, two sections are expected: Summary and Response.\n\nB. A Final Project: The final project can be a formal essay, or a research proposal, on a specific topic that is closely related to the course content.\n\nV.          Grading:\n\nParticipation in oral and written discussion        20%\n\nPresentation of assigned reading                        20%\n\nResponse paper                                                   15%                        \n\nFinal project:              oral presentation               15% \n\n                                   written paper                     30%",
