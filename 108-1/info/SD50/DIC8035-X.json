    "description": "Impact of global environmental change on organisms is getting more and more significant. One of the worst situations is that the change has caused an unexpectedly high extinction rate of species in Earth history, i.e., one thousand times higher than fossil record. Biodiversity conservation now becomes one of the important and noticeable public agenda. Why is biodiversity so important? What is biodiversity? This is the main aim of this course to lead students to know “biodiversity” and the relevant researches, particularly the recent studies. Moreover, the course will also extend beyond biodiversity and introduce the policies for biodiversity conservation and management in different countries as well as existing or potential conflicts. There are many angles discussing about this agenda. Therefore student questions and discussion designed will be one of the two important parts in this course that will facilitate students to have more understanding of biodiversity. In the end, we hope this course not only providing the knowledge of biodiversity but also giving students a great chance to have critical thinking and discussing of the complex issues beyond biodiversity.",
