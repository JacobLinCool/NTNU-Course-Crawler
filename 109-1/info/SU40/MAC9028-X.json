    "description": "This course helps (3rd- or 4th-year mathematics-major) students reflect upon the nature and historical developments of mathematics in a variety of cultures and in different periods of time, from the dawn of human civilization up until the 19th century. In particular, students will see how cultural elements play an important role in mathematical studies, as we discuss Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, medieval European/Islamic, and East Asian mathematics, and some topics in early modern mathematics. These topics aim to improve students’ international mindedness on the history of mathematics, and help them see the connection between mathematics in different cultures.",
    "goals": [
        "To demonstrate the ability to see the mathematical structure behind certain problems or procedures in history",
        "To apply critical thinking skills through the reflexion on the philosophical standpoints of mathematics",
        "To have the ability to present a group project to the class",
        "To form one’s own ideas and to be able to describe why mathematics is “interesting”, the reasons of which can be internal or external to mathematics such as the influence of cultural reasons",
        "To demonstrate one’s beliefs that in different contexts there can be different standards for “good” or “useful” mathematics",
        "To know that mathematics has its cultural elements, and learn to have inter-cultural understanding and respect for others"
