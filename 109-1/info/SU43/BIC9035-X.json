    "description": "This course will introduce multivariate and spatial statistical techniques for analysis of ecological data using R programming language. Bioconductor work flow for high-throughput sequence analysis will also be covered. The details of R functions and scripts in relation to various types of multivariate, spatial and sequence analyses will be described in lecture. Homework assignments with various types of ecological and evolutionary data will be made available to students.",
