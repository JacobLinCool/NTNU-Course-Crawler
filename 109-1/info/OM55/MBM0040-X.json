    "description": "整合性行銷溝通是行銷領域的進階課程，著重在理論背景與實務操作的整合。整合性行銷溝通所使用的行銷工具很多，學生在這門課除了學習行銷溝通中各種工具的概念(例如廣告設計，公共關係，促銷設計，事件行銷，直效行銷，網路行銷，人員行銷)之外，更需要學習並試著提出行銷整合策略的思維鍛鍊。關於理論背景的建構，本課程的教學分成兩大部分:一為教師講授與師生課堂互動，二為個案分析與行銷溝通相關的文章研討。而在實務能力建構部分，則包括期中階段-管院人文領導品牌行銷溝通能力微電影競賽；以及期末階段-企業IMC議題解決顧問競賽。期待透過理論與實務的結合，能讓同學們在這門課培養行銷溝通的相關能力。",
