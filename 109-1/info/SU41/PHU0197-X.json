    "syllabus": "In this course, we will introduce many useful numerical techniques and methods. In particular, we will apply these methods to solve physical problems. We will use python to implement the introduced techniques and methods. Based on the progress (and feedback) of (from) the registered students, we might skip some listed topics and (or) introduce other (new) techniques.\n\nWeek 1: Introduction: Several real physical problems that require some numerical methods to solve, as well as some basis of python programming.\n\nWeek 2: Introduction to python 1:  \" for \", \" range \", \" while \", and \" if - else \".   \n\nWeek 3: Introduction to python 2: array and list, \" loadtxt \", \"open\", \" write \", and \" close \".\n\nWeeks 4, 5, and 6: Introduction to python 3: plot, density plot, and animation in python. Animation using vpython (optional). \n\nWeek 7 and 8: Numerical differential (forward, backward, central, five points and so on) and integration (Trapezoidal rule).\n\nWeek 9: In class (or take home) midterm exam.\n\nWeek 10: Numerical integration: Simpson's rule and Gaussian quadrature.\n\nWeek 11: multidimensional integration. Nonlinear equations (single variable): Fixed point method and binary search.\n\nWeeks 12 and 13: Nonlinear equations (single variable): Newton (and secant) method(s). Ordinary differential equations (ODEs): Initial valued problems (Euler and improved Euler methods).\n\nWeek 14: Runge Kutta and other methods for initial valued problems .\n\nWeek 15: Solving linear equations using scipy and numpy.\n\nWeek 16: Symbolic python.\n\nWeeks 17 and 18: Presentations by students.",
