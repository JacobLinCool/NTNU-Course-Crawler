    "syllabus": "**Objectives**: This course is designed to support students in their use of Science English language and to **improve their proficiency** through intensive and extensive skill/strategy training. This class also aims to **build up students’ proficiency** **in** all four language skills—**reading, listening, speaking and writing** —through a series of activities and tasks. In order to do so, there a **three-pronged approach** to the course:\n\n**1)** Firstly, there will be **no course textbook!** 9 groups of three or four students will be responsible for **choosing an article, video and/or other material** for each class under the general theme of science, and inform the teacher more than a week before the class. Then on the day itself the group will give a **short PPT summarizing the main points** of their chosen material. They will also have made a **comprehension and discussion worksheet** on the material to be followed by **an activity or a game**.\n\n**2)** Secondly, over the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a **task-based project**, in which the task groups are asked to **prepare an experiment** in an area or topic that is of interest to them, **present their experiment** to the class at mid-term, and then **write up a report** on their experiments.\n\n**3)** Thirdly, over the course of the second half of the semester, students will undertake a **writing workshop**, in which students are asked to **investigate and write a five-paragraph about scientific areas and topics** that have been taught throughout the course or that are of interest to them.\n\n**4)** Furthermore, students should **compile a portfolio in their notebooks** outlining the major English-language experiences they have had during the semester. **Proof of any autonomous work** is mandatory and will be graded.\n\n**All elements** of the course **will be evaluated and assessed** when calculating the final grade.\n\n**Course** **Materials:**\n\nThere is **no textbook!** A **notebook is necessary** for taking notes on new vocabulary, phrases, grammar, task project, and homework assignments.\n\n**Course Schedule**\n\n**Wk**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Content**\n\n**Notes**\n\n**1**\n\n**9/14**\n\nIntro, Orientation, Table Quiz, Cards\n-------------------------------------\n\n**2**\n\n**9/21**\n\n1.
