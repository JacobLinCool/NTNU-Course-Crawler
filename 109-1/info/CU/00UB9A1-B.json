    "syllabus": "**English III: Literature and Culture**\n\n**“**What is important now is to recover our senses. We must learn to see more, to hear more, to feel more. Our  task  is  not  to  find  the  maximum amount  of  content  in  a  work  of  art,  much  less  to squeeze more content out of the work than is already there. Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all. The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art—and, by analogy, our own experience—more, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is rather than to show what it means. In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.”  **from “Beyond Interpretation” by Susan Sontag**\n\n**Objectives****:**\n\nThis course is designed to **introduce** students to **acclaimed Anglophone literature and poetry** from ancient times to the present day. The overall aim is to become **more critical readers in English** by **analysing several texts** and **learning some essential literary terms and devices**. At the same time, we will **delve into the cultures** that we meet along the way in an effort to **better understand the readings and authors** we encounter. The major pedagogical focus will be on **improving student fluency** in expressing ideas **both orally and in written forms in English**.\n\nHence, there will be a three-pronged approach to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** this is **a flip class.** There will be **several short readings** which students **must read** for homework before they come to class. Each of these readings will be analysed and discussed in the following class. The various readings will come from **a variety of cultures and time periods** and each will be examined. These readings will be assessed through homework assignments and a quiz.\n\n**2) Secondly,** you will be asked to join a **book club group**, where you will read and analyse a classic novel of your choice and **give a presentation** at the end of the course.\n\n**3) Finally**, students will be asked to **write** **a children’s book review** and **a short critical essay,** the latter based on the readings done in class.\n\n**N.B. All elements to the course will be assessed for the final grade.**\n\n**Textbook:** The readings and the novel will be provided by the teacher either through handouts, online or via our moodle page. However, you will have to buy, borrow, or download the book your book club chooses\n\n**Online material:** moodle2.ntnu.edu.tw/ ([1081英文（三）：文學與文化](https://moodle2.ntnu.edu.tw/course/view.php?id=16981))\n\n**literatureandhistory.com, historyofliterature.com**\n\n**Materials:** A **notebook** is recommended for taking notes and doing assignments.\n\n**Schedule:** This is a tentative schedule and may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion. \n\nWk\n\nDate\n\nContent\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n9/18\n\n   Introduction and Orientation\n-------------------------------\n\n**Choose a kid’s book**\n\n2\n\n9/25\n\n1.
