    "syllabus": "**Course Description:**\n\nThis course is designed to introduce NTNU students to university-level English. It will train students to listen to English text materials and it will also guide students to read, discuss and respond to critical essays analyzing four popular literary genres including romance, horror, detective and fantasy. Students will have the chance to apply the language skills they have learned through eight listening transcriptions, one midterm and one final exam, one individual presentation, and near the end of this course, through a group presentation in the form of a micro film. Students are expected to attend regularly, to contribute with compassion and creativity, and to show commitment to course assignments and group activities. The course attempts to facilitate English learning beyond technicality—as means to think critically about how contemporary popular culture sheds light on the study of the humanities.\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n[教學進度與主題附件](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=03bffad2138e40e1bec6be41e0994ef2&fno=4ae0178f98f74c5899a9f13b24bcb67c)",
