    "description": "Strategic management deals with decisions that fundamentally influence the direction of the organization and effective implementation of the direction chosen. Strategic management examines the organizational structure, resources & capabilities, and the strategic positioning of the organization to create, capture and sustain competitive advantage. In addition to economic value creation, management also must make decisions concerning the distribution of this economic value.\nIn this course we integrate these views together by taking the unique perspective of the situational problems of the general manager.  The general manager's primary responsibility is to diagnose the critical factors that require attention in complex business situations and to find workable solutions to strategic and organizational problems. To solve such business problems, the general manager must be capable of understanding and using knowledge from each functional area to provide a \"total business\" (systems) perspective on issues pertaining to strategic management. Thus, I will introduce a STRATEGY MATRIX (策略矩陣) developed by professor Seetoo (司徒達賢) as an exemplar to describe and analysis the business strategy of a particular company.\nThis course focuses on key issues in formulating and implementing strategies to create and sustain competitive advantage.  Emphasis is given to developing pragmatic and action-oriented general management skills.  Extant theory within the fields of strategy, accounting, economics, finance, inter- national business, marketing, political science and organization theory have important implications for general management. Thus, this course emphasizes cases and lecture/discussions.",
