We will explore the nature of adolescent development in terms of biological, cognitive, social, and emotional development. How the social contexts of peers and families affect the psychological well-being of adolescents will be considered. Emphasis will be placed on theory and research as sources of knowledge. By the end of the semester, students should arrive at a better understanding of how biological and social factors play a role in adolescent development.",
