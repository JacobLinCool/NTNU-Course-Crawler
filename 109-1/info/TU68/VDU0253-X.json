The enrolled students start with investigation for defining what is innovative design by searching different types of design. The first theme is “Cardboard Furniture”, which explore the possibility of utilizing corrugated cardboard paper as one of the most accessible material for designer. The second theme is “Shelter for disaster”, which investigate farther usage of corrugated cardboard to create a shelter design for the case of disaster. Students spend roughly six weeks to develop their research and design and make final presentation to determine the grade.  \n\n  \n教學進度與主題   \n\n(1) Cardboard Furniture \n\n(2) Shelter for disaster \n\n毎週進度 \n\n週次上課日期課程進度、内容、主題 \n\n2020/09/17 第一週課程紹介。(1) Cardboard Furniture \n\n2020/09/24 Students design research presentation (PPT 10-15 min per) \n\n2020/10/01 National Holliday  \n\n2020/10/08 Students design concept and sketch development  \n\n2020/10/15 Students model development (1/5 scale) \n\n2020/10/22 The design concept and model presentation (P1-1)  \n\n2020/10/29 Individual desk critic and model adjustment \n\n2020/11/05 First theme final presentation (1/1 scale) (P1-Final)  \n\n2020/11/12 Midterm Week (No Class) \n\n2020/11/19 Second assignment (2) Shelter for disaster \n\n2020/11/26 Students design research presentation (PPT 10-15 min per) \n\n2020/12/03 Student design concept and sketch development \n\n2020/12/10 Students model development (1/10 Scale) \n\n2020/12/17 The design concept and model presentation (P2-1) \n\n2020/12/24 Individual desk critic and model adjustment \n\n2020/12/31 Finalize the design concept and model \n\n2021/01/07 Second theme final presentation (P2-Final) \n\n2021/01/14 Semester portfolio report, exhibition and grading",
