    "syllabus": "Basic Design I \n\n開課系級 設計系1年級   \n  \n課程簡介  \nThis course is a fundamental level class structured for the student who plan to pursue a career in design field. Students will experience the design process through developing their own project and facing the difficulty of dealing with real material, form and compositions.    \n  \n課程目標 \n\n*   Development and understanding of technical skills such as simple drawing, painting and cutting skills needed to render well composed 2-dimensional designs. \n*   Development and understanding of crafting skills such as cutting and gluing, composing 3-dimensional volume, and articulating the possible function.  \n*   Develop an outstanding work ethic and the commitment necessary to succeed in achieving the above stated goals and objectives.   \n     \n\n教學進度與主題 \n\nThis class reinforce for knowledge and skill for pursuing design education through various design projects during the semester. There are three projects for students to explore the different approach to develop their foundation of design. The first assignment is focusing on drawing skill, abstraction process, and model making with training the observation skill of others. The second project is to develop the skill of deconstruction, composition and 2-dimensional drawing skill. The last project is to develop observation skill, abstraction process, and scale and proportion articulation. Students are evaluated through these three projects, attendance to the class, and the end of semester final report.   \n \n\n教學進度與主題 \n\n(1) Portrait to 3D (P1) \n\n(2) Positive and Negative (P2) \n\n(3) Point, Line, and Volume (P3) \n\n毎週進度 \n\n週次上課日期課程進度、内容、主題 \n\n2020/09/16 Class introduction and First assignment announcement (P1-1) \n\n2020/09/23 Drawing portrait of partner (P1-2) \n\n2020/09/30 Portrait to diagram (P1-3) \n\n2020/10/07 Diagram to 3D wearable device (P1-4) \n\n2020/10/14 First assignment final presentation (P1-Final) \n\n2020/10/21 Second assignment announcement (P2-1) \n\n2020/10/28 First volume making (P2-2) \n\n2020/11/04 Deconstruct the volume and Create Drawing (P2-3) \n\n2020/11/11 Midterm Week (No Class) \n\n2020/11/18 Second assignment final presentation (P2-Final) \n\n2020/11/25 Third assignment announcement (P3-1) \n\n2020/12/02 Picture selection and analysis (P3-2) \n\n2020/12/09 Creating Diagram form the analysis (P3-3) \n\n2020/12/16 Diagram to 3D model (P3-4) \n\n2020/12/23 Finalize the scale and function of model (P3-5) \n\n2020/12/30 Third assignment final presentation (P3-Final) \n\n2021/01/06 Report making (No Class) \n\n2021/01/13 P1+P2+P3 final report submission (Online)",
