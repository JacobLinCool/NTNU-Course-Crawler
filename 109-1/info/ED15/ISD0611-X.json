    "description": "This seminar serves as a forum to foster a research culture in the department and discuss the theoretical and practical issues of conducting research and completing a graduate degree in Library and Information Science (LIS).  For that purpose, the goal is in two-fold: to discuss and explore important research issues in LIS; to learn the practical skills of giving a presentation and writing a research paper.  The course is organized as a number of lectures on giving presentations, writing papers, and other aspects of performing research and publishing papers, along with a number of invited research talks and colloquia.  As such, all LIS master and PhD students are welcome and encouraged to attend the scheduled lectures, presentations, and colloquium.",
