    "description": "Appeared with the industrialization and associated to its mechanical character, the photographic medium was not considered at its very beginnings as an art. Though photography took rapidly an important place in the creative process of traditional mediums such as painting or sculpture, it is only one hundred and fifty years after its invention – from the 1970s onward – that it has gained a cultural and institutional legitimacy. It makes no doubt that the apparition of photography in the field of images transformed the whole mode of visual perception, not to say that it affected the means of artistic production, and changed several criteria defining the notions of art and author. Walter Benjamin in his essay The Artwork in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility already perceived at the end of the 1930’s, thatthe loss of authenticity revealed by the substitution of the hand, the eye and the traditional tools of the drawer, the painter, the etcher or the sculptor for an optical and chemical machine (the camera), as well as the possibility of multiplying the work, modified the perception of the original artwork, and annihilated its aura. The changes made possible with the coming of the photographic medium can be understood through the collective perception dictated by it. The same conception was also mentioned by the great photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson in an interview he gave to a Brasilian newspaper in 1969, arguing that photography democratized the notion of art and artist: “From the photographic point of view everybody is potentially an artist.” The course will provide a comprehensive survey on the history of photography by focusing the most important issues related to its relationship to art and to its status as an art. As we will see the relations between the photographic medium and the traditional arts have been marked by rivalry, or contempt, but also by emulation and mutual respect.",
