In the second half of the semester, each student will choose an English article and report on the issues/problems he/she encounters in the essay. Together we will explore the “island encounter” defined as such. Students will be expected to turn in a final term paper that investigates a certain issue in relation to the issue(s) under study.      \n\n**Objectives**\n\nTo cultivate the reading abilities in historical documents in English\n\nTo enhance knowledge and interest in the said area of enquiry\n\nTo develop capacities in independent research\n\nTo work on the draft of a publishable academic paper\n\n**Requirements**  \nYou are expected to come to class prepared! **Before** class, you should have done all readings, worked on the homework problems and you should be able to participate fully in the discussions.  \n1) Attendance and Participation, 10%\n\n2) Oral Reports, 30%\n\n3) Midterm Literature Review, 20% (a short paper about 3-4 pages)\n\n4) Final Term Paper, 40% (the final term paper about 10 pages) \n\n**Textbook**\n\nThe Chinese translation of _Curious Investigations: 19th-century American and European Impressions of Taiwan_ (《看見十九世紀台灣: 十四位西方旅行者的福爾摩沙故事》，台北: 如果，2006.)
