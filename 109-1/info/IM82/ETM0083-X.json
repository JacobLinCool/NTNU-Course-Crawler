The emphasis would be placed on the ambiguous dichotomy and dialectical ambiguity of two essential schools of thought: humanism and posthumanism. To better understand the speculative literature, we will have recourse to several contemporary theorists and/or thinkers, such as Cary Wolfe, Donna Haraway, Katherine Hayles, Bruno Latour, and Michel Serres. We will devote our discussion to the works of European si-fi/fantasy writers of eight countries. In an age of information technology where almost every kind of knowledge is on the Internet, speculative literature plays a crucial role to show not so much the restoration of a non-existent fantastic world, as the stimulation and evolution of culturally-modified fantasy and the making of fantasy in the posthumanist experiences.",
