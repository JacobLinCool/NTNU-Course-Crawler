    "description": "I. The course illustrates how successful human resource management must function in a competitive world. In particular, International Human Resource Management (IHRM) activities are placed in a global context, known differently from those conducted locally. It can be seen such as:\n1. The composition of multi-cultural management teams, human resource policies and practices are globally operated; \n2. Organizations utilizing their operations into social contexts with which they are unfamiliar or new; \n3. Employees from different cultural backgrounds working together;\n4. Managing expatriates with an emphasis on staff recruitment for international assignments, expat-preparation, re-entry training, and development are more complex than local businesses.\n\nII. Packed with current examples that reflect the vibrancy of the international business field, this course offers a managerial approach that keeps an emphasis on international employment, compensation and benefits, talent management and repatriation from multi-cultural perspective. Among them, a critical evaluation of the effectiveness of international deployment as well as current trends in IHRM will be addressed. After completion of this course, students shall be able: \n1. To recognize the complexity & challenges of managing in multicultural and international contexts. \n2. To understand the impact of culture on work and human resource management.\n3. To communicate effectively on international human resource management issues. \n4. To address and apply conceptual issues related to implementation of international human resource management.",
