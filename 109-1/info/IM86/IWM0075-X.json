    "description": "This course is an applied course, designed to provide students an introduction to statistical techniques used to conduct HR and other data-based research to make decisions. The context is human resource development, but the applications are also relevant to other business and management research and decisions. An emphasis is on fostering (a) a conceptual understanding of different statistical techniques so the student will know which statistical analysis is appropriate for answering a particular research question (e.g., which training program is more effective? will higher job satisfaction lead to higher performance? etc.) and (b) a practical set of skills so the student can carry out the analysis, and (c) an appropriate understanding of the statistical theories so the student will be able to interpret the outcome of an analysis and make the correct decision.",

The emphasis in this course is on developing a basic understanding of statistics commonly used in human resource related fields, knowing how to calculate various statistics using SPSS and SEM packages such as AMOS, and most importantly, how to interpret results.\n\nLearning Goals:\n\nUpon completion of this course students will:\n\n1\\. Understand the fundamentals of sampling and probability and the role they play in inferential statistics.\n\n2\\. Be able to calculate and use descriptive statistics.\n\n3\\. Be able to calculate and use statistics testing significant differences.\n\n4\\. Be able to calculate and use statistics measuring relationships and causality.\n\n5\\. Be able to calculate and interpret statistics commonly used by human resource professionals.\n\n6\\. Be able to explain analytical outputs both orally and in writing.\n\nWeek\n\nTopic\n\n1\n\nCourse Introduction, Syllabus Review\n\n2\n\nIntroduction of research & Data analysis procedure\n\nIntroduction of statistics\n\n*   Understanding data\n\n3\n\nNo class (National Day holiday)\n\n4\n\nIntroduction of statistics\n\n*   Choosing appropriate statistical tests\n*   Introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics\n\n5\n\nIntroduction to SPSS\n\n*   The structure & interfaces\n\n*   The basics of SPSS: creating data files, entering & organizing data\n*   Transforming & calculating data\n\n6\n\nDescriptive statistics and graphs\n\n*   Distribution of data\n*   Sample profile analysis\n\n7\n\nMean comparison\n\n*   t-test\n*   ANOVA\n\n8\n\nTesting association\n\n*   Correlation\n*   Regression\n\n9\n\nMid-term exam\n\n10\n\n Regression\n\n*   Simple regression\n*   Multiple & Hierarchical regression\n\n11\n\nRegression\n\n*   Testing moderation & mediation \n\n12\n\nValidity & reliability analysis\n\n*   Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in SPSS\n*   Reliability analysis\n\n13\n\nValidity & reliability analysis\n\n*   Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in SEM\n\n14\n\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM): Path model\n\n15\n\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM): Path model\n\n16\n\nFinal Exam\n\n17\n\nFinal project presentation\n\n18\n\nFinal project presentation",
