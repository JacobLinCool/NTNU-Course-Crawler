    "description": "The ethical turn, which has become a predominant mode of thinking since the 1980s, has prompted the academics to confront the questions of trauma and collective responsibility left behind as a result of violent histories such as the Holocaust, slavery, colonialism, and other events of violence. Yet over the past decade, the tendency of such ethical intervention has triggered concern and reflections over the ways the desire to claim moral and political potency may lead to critical impasse in many ethical discussions. This course aims to explore this contested field through the study of contemporary testimonial literature and cultural and philosophical accounts with regard to ethics, aesthetics, and politics. As a means of articulation, a way of intervention, and also an ethical gesture, in what ways aesthetic expression may bring about its own ethical imaginary and approach so as to resist “the tendency of simplification and the intellectual and moral limitations caused by such simplification,” as Primo Levi points out in his essay “The Gray Zone”? This, I think, is the main concern of this course.",

This course aims to explore this contested field through the study of contemporary testimonial literature and cultural and philosophical accounts with regard to ethics, aesthetics, and politics. As a means of articulation, a way of intervention, and also an ethical gesture, in what ways aesthetic expression may bring about its own ethical imaginary and approach so as to resist “the tendency of simplification and the intellectual and moral limitations caused by such simplification,” as Primo Levi points out in his essay “The Gray Zone”?
