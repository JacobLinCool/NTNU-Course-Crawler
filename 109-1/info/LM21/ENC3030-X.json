    "description": "This is a 3-point course designed to introduce you to the fundamental principles of second-language acquisition (SLA) research and its implications for language teaching or applied linguistics research. This course addresses second-language (SL) development from an interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional approach and addresses SL development from an interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional approach. The topics covered revolve around studies focusing on the learners' language and development, on internal and external factors affecting SLA, on studies looking at SLA and learner strategies and styles, and finally, on studies relating to SL learning in naturalistic and instructed settings. Throughout the course, the instructor will lead students to explore how the teaching, learning and assessment of second language knowledge (lexical, discourse, pragmatic, grammar) have been conceptualized, researched and explained in recent decades.",
