    "description": "This course is intended to explore the workings of Universal Grammar by comparing the syntax of Chinese and the syntax of English (as well as other languages when necessary). Important topics in syntax will be discussed by covering both classical and up-to-date works. With the goal to enhance the understanding of Universal Grammar, this course will benefit not only students who are interested in syntactic theory, Chinese and English syntax, but also those working on interfaces between syntax and other linguistic areas (such as sentence processing, L1 or L2 acquisition, etc.).",
