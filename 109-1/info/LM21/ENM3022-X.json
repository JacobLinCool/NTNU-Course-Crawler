The class will be a seminar and will be conducted as lecture/discussion. A reading packet will be compiled as a major text for this course. The reading material for the course will include observational and experimental studies, but no prior experience with research and teaching is required. We will read, analyze, and discuss a couple of articles/ book chapters per week. Students will demonstrate their understanding of L2 reading process and outcome by designing a teaching material and planning a lesson for it. In addition, based on the discussion and critique on the issues presented in the course materials, students will write a response paper. The argument made in the response paper will be developed into a research proposal.",

    "syllabus": "**Studies in EFL Reading (Spring.2020)**\n\nInstructor: Hsi-chin Chu (e-mail: hcchu@ntnu.edu.tw)\n\nOffice:誠801  Office Hours：10:00-12:00, Thu. & 13:30-15:30, Fri., or by appointment\n\n**Course Description:**\n\n        This course is designed to introduce current research and thinking about how second language learners read, what factors affect the development of second language reading capacity, and what types of comprehension readers may attain. The class will be a seminar and will be conducted as lecture/discussion. A reading list will be compiled as a major text for this course. The reading materials for the course will include observational and experimental studies, but no prior experience with research and teaching is required. We will read, analyze, and discuss a couple of articles/book chapters per week. Throughout the semester, students will have a variety of assignments: 1) **oral presentation** of the synopsis of the assigned articles, 2) a **lesson plan** for selected readers, and 3) oral and written presentation of a **proposal**.\n\n**Oral Presentation & Discussion Lead:** For each article in the reading list, students will rotate presenting the synopsis and leading the in-class discussion. It is expected that a potential research space will be explored/identified towards the end of discussion and the presenter will post the related questions by the following week.\n\n**Lesson Plan (paired work):** Students in pairs will design a lesson plan with worksheets will be designed and the rationale of the design, based on the reading theories and research studies, will be presented in a PPT some time during the mid-term.\n\n**Proposal:** At the end of the semester students will submit a proposal (about 10 pages, default spaced) on a topic that is of maximum interest and usefulness. This decision should be made sometime after the mid-term.\n\nGrading policy:\n\n        **Oral presentation** of the assigned reading: 20% (with PPT posted before and potential RQ posted after oral presentation, on MOODLE)\n\n        Project 1: (paired work) PPT presentation of **a lesson plan**: 20%\n\n        Project 2 (individual work): **a proposal**, to be presented in class: 40%\n\n        Class attendance and class **participation**: 20%\n\n**Texts:**\n\nA series of articles available either on MOODLE or in hard copies (\\*).\n\n**References:**\n\nGrabe, William (2009).
