    "description": "This course aims to help students develop the ability to compose a well-organized and well-focused academic essay in English. Its goals are to introduce strategies for the purpose, organization, presentation, development, coherence, and unity of thesis writing. Essential elements in a thesis such as summaries, abstracts, arguments, data commentaries, critiques, etc. will be discussed and practice in writing will be assigned. Whenever appropriate, we will also talk about skills in doing independent academic research in language and linguistics. Students are expected to learn to use library resources and explore various approaches of data collection and analysis. The ultimate purpose is to familiarize students with the steps in doing academic research and help them develop abilities in critical thinking/writing, intellectual reasoning, problem-solving, and collaborative learning.",
