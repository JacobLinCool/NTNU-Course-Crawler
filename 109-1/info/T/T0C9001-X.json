    "syllabus": "**課程主旨** **(Goal)**:\n\nOur goal is to develop the computing environment that links our lifestyles, experiences and the Internet together: building the network to engage experience sharing in our daily life. We leverage the Internet to create and share our activities in addition, analyze and predict trends. These activities will develop a way to improve way to share our daily experiences. This unrestricted global environment will improve communication between and within the Internet and the real world, promoting the creation of new products and services. This intensive course set the field inside NTNU, we expect students to rediscover the campus and pull out the hidden touch point for newcomers. The key elements for the lecture will be HCI, J-ACG (included music), and Media design.\n\n**進度** **(schedule)**:\n\n1.  Innovation pipeline 1 Media DesignWhat is Media and design? We will explore the concept of design in the first class. In addition, we will also understand how the Internet are being incorporated into modern design.\n2.  Innovation pipeline 2 TechnologyModern Media Design requires a technology to realize. We will learn how technology are being put together to implement a design concept: making it into reality. Such software and hardware tools like Arduino or Unity are encouraged to learn in advance, this lecture will focus on application and design but not limits in skill itself. We also welcome different aspect of expression.\n3.  Innovation pipeline 3 J-ACG\"Anime\", \"Game\", \"Comic\", and \"Cosplay\" are some of the aggressive and innovative forms of pop culture found in Japan and now spreading worldwide. So called “Otaku” culture are now focused throughout the globe and giving Japan an important role to enhance innovative creativity. We explore the roots of these otaku cultural activities in Japan, considering these contents as a material, Class seeks the international expansion as one of Simulacra delivered by creators, and activists of these fields: How the technology has been created, and knowing its real motivation to drive these sub-cultural activities.\n4.  Innovation pipeline 4 Project managementLearn management-related skills which will be necessary and important for projects to realize. This includes business strategy and model, coordination and behavioral economics.\n5.  Design research: Fieldwork and observationDesign Thinking Introduction, Philosophy, Vision, How to do Fieldwork, Fieldwork Analysis, Mental Model, Target Persona discussion\n6.  Design research: Prototyping\n7.  ImplementationCarrying ideas and concepts generated during ethnography phase into the physical form will require several iterations of prototyping. You will be experiencing Structured Design Process and how to identify your prototype idea(s). Identify what are the features and needs of your product.\n8.  Final Presentation",
