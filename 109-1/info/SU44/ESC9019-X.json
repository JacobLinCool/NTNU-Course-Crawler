    "description": "Marine geology is concerned with the character and history of that part of the earth covered by seawater. The importance of marine geology is evident when we consider that almost three-fourths of the earth’s surface is covered by water. Areas of concern range from beach to marine marshes and lagoons, across the continental shelf, and down to the deepest parts of the ocean.",
    "goals": [
        "Develop an understanding of the structure of the earth beneath oceans, the history and character of processes that have shaped the earth beneath the sea, and oceanic and global history itself.",
        "Understand the submarine erosional and depositional processes.",
        "Can work with colleagues about the geology underneath the sea.",
        "Can use the professional techniques to work on marine geological issues"
