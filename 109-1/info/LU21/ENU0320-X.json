    "description": "In this course students learn the basic skills of doing research in literature and cultural studies: read cinematic, literary and critical texts, find research topics, gather reference materials, learn appropriate reference style, and write papers. A central theme of research will be chosen every time this course is offered. In Fall 2020, the central topic of research will be “language.” A series of films, literary and critical texts on issues of language/communication will be gathered for the study of the nature of language: What is language? What are the functions of language? Is language a tool of communication or does it hamper communication? Do we use language or does language use us? Is language gendered? Is there power in language or does the power come from the person who uses language? Also, how does language travel across cultures? Are there specific languages which are more capable of communicating love and emotions than other languages? What are the differences between adults’ and children’s languages? What would extraterrestrial beings’ language look/sound like and in what way could different languages affect our conceptions of reality? Questions like these and others will be asked throughout the semester. Students are encouraged to come up with their own discussions and critical opinions based on their understanding of the selected cinematic and literary texts. In addition to probing into specific texts, students will also be introduced to library catalogues and databases, as well as learn the basic MLA reference style, practice the skills of citation and documentation, build up a bibliography on the research topic of their choice, read sample papers, sharpen writing ability and ultimately produce a short research paper of 5-7 pages.",
