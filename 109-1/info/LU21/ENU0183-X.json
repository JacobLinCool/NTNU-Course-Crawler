    "syllabus": "**_Course description_**\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the characters and stories of the Bible, Greek and Roman mythology. The course emphasizes creation, nature and hero myths as they shaped ancient civilizations. It focuses on the major themes and developments that have had the greatest impact on the Western tradition. It is envisioned as an introduction to Western Culture, Art and Literature.\n\n**_Objectives_**\n\nThe main goals of the course are the following:\n\n1.      to familiarize students with the main themes of the Bible, characters, themes and stories of the major ancient Greek and Roman mythology;\n\n2.      to enable them to compare and contrast significant characters, events, symbols, and actions in one story with similar events in another story;\n\n3.      to give students some familiarity with the visual arts that depict the Bible and legends of Ancient Greece and Rome.\n\n**_Textbooks_**\n\nHamilton, Edith. _Mythology_ (210 NT, Bookman)\n\n_Norton Anthology of Western Literature_, 8th edition Vol. 1 (1145 NT, Bookman)\n\nHandouts on Moodle [http://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/](`http://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/`)\n\n**_Course requirements_**\n\nStudents are expected to be familiar with the required readings prior to class discussions. Students will be graded on the basis of (1) their active participation in the class discussions and on moodle—20%, (2) a midterm test—25%, (3) the final test—25%, and (4) a group research project—30%. This is a written presentation of a major hero or theme discussed in class and its representations in literature and visual arts. Guidelines for the group project will be given in class. Failure to take the midterm and final tests, attend classes and submit the research project on time will result in the student’s inability to pass the exam.\n\n**_Academic Dishonesty_**\n\nAcademic dishonesty is defined as but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, misrepresenting one’s work, and forging documentation. Academic dishonesty is a serious matter. I am savvy and vigilant in detecting students who use unattributed sources, citing references without indicating the sources or “collaborate” with fellow students during exams. Any student who plagiarizes or cheats will fail the course.\n\n**_Schedule_**\n\n**Week 1**\n\n**Introduction & General Background**\n\n**Week 2**\n\n**What are myths?
