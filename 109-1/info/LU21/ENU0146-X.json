    "description": "This course focuses on women’s literature, including both fictional and non-fictional writings. Supplementary theoretical texts are also included in the course to serve as critical lenses to analyze women’s writings. The course will discuss various topics that center on women’s experiences of their bodies, such as body image, the writing body, the sexual body, the body with illness, the racialized body, and the ecological body. Although the themes of pain, violence and suffering may reoccur in the readings, this course encourages students to adopt a critical framework of difference to further investigate how healing possibilities are envisioned in the women’s writings. \n\nThis course aims to provide a learning environment for students to practice more responsible and ethical ways of knowing differences, to bridge literary works with social reality in our time, and to imagine social justice collaboratively. The course also invites students to challenge dichotomous thinking by being open to readings that deliberately blur the boundary of difference and to a cross-disciplinary reading practice. Much of the learning in this course will be through critical discussions, group presentations, analysis on the basis of individual and collective efforts, and reflection on personal experiences.",
