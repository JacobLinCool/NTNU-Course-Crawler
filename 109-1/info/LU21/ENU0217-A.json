    "syllabus": "**Public Speaking: Speech Skills**\n\nNational Taiwan Normal University, Fall 2016\n\nMondays, 12:20-14:10\n\nJustin Prystash                                                      \n\nOffice:     719                \n\nOffice Hours: W 11:20-13:10; F 12:20-14:10\n\nEmail: jprystash@ntnu.edu.tw or jprystash@hotmail.com        \n\n**Course Description**\n\nThis course focuses on acquiring the skills of interpersonal communication and public speaking, which includes both building a speech and performing a speech. The two main types of public speech we will focus on are informative speeches and persuasive speeches.\n\n**Attendance and Participation**\n\nStudents are expected to regularly attend and participate in class (the point of the class is to speak in public, after all). Almost every week, we will have a group activity that will help you practice your speaking skills, and you need to fully engage in these activities.\n\n**Informative and Persuasive Speeches**\n\nStudents are required to give two major speeches: one informative and one persuasive. Each speech should be 10 minutes in length and you will be graded by the entire audience (not just me) on the following aspects: poise, voice, life, eye contact, gestures, and speed.\n\n**Written Work**\n\nWhy is there written work in a speech class? Because to give a good speech, you need to be prepared. Building a good speech is the necessary foundation for performing the speech well. For each of the two major speeches, you will submit a written version of the speech that will be graded on the following aspects: content, organization, and visual aids. Just remember that when you _perform_ your speech, you should not read from or memorize the written speech.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nWeek 1, 9/12: Introduction\n\nWeek 2, 9/19: Poise and Voice; Brown Bag Self-Introductions\n\nWeek 3, 9/26: Life and Eye Contact; Short Informative Speeches\n\nWeek 4, 10/3: Gestures and Speed; Demonstration Speeches\n\nWeek 5, 10/10: **Holiday, No Class**\n\nWeek 6, 10/17: Audience, Content, Organization, and Visual Aids; Small Group Brainstorming\n\nWeek 7, 10/24: Poise and Voice; News Roundtable\n\nWeek 8, 10/31: Informative Speeches\n\nWeek 9, 11/7: Informative Speeches\n\nWeek 10, 11/14: Informative Speeches\n\nWeek 11, 11/21: Life and Eye Contact; Small Group Debates\n\nWeek 12, 11/28: Gestures and Speed; Small Group Debates; Small Group Brainstorming\n\nWeek 13, 12/5: Audience, Content Organization, and Visual Aids; Traveling Debates\n\nWeek 14, 12/12: Persuasive Speeches\n\nWeek 15, 12/19: Persuasive Speeches\n\nWeek 16, 12/26: Persuasive Speeches\n\nWeek 17, 1/2: **Holiday, No Class**\n\nWeek 18, 1/9: Murder Mystery Party",
