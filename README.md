# Crawled Data

Data in this branch were crawled by NTNU Course Crawler.

If you don't want to crawl data by yourself, you can download the data from this branch.

**I recommend you to use the data from "squashed" folder first. They are composed of all *meta* or *info* in a semester.**

The "squashed" structure:

```json
// squashed/XXX-X.json
[ info1, info2, info3, ... ]
```

***If there is any problem with the data, feel free to contact me. But you must understand that is not my responsibility to provide you with the flawless data.***
