    "description": "This two-semester course is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. In the first semester, students are expected to acquire the fundamentals of English paragraph-writing, including structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), outline, organization and coherence. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. In addition, this course aims to equip students with analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, definition, and classification.",

    "syllabus": "Guided Writing (Spring,2020)\n\nInstructor: Hsi-chin Janet Chu\n\nEmail: hcchu@ntnu.edu.tw\n\nOffice: 誠801\n\nOffice Hours: 15：00-17：00，Thu.； 10：00-12：00， Fri.\n\nCourse Description\n\n**Guided Writing**\n\n1.  **Goal**: \n\nThis course is designed to foster effective English written communication in an academic setting. By directing students’ attention to the rhetorical features of English language writing, students will be aware of the English academic writing conventions that are commonly practiced in academic communication and thus use the conventions in their English writing. To achieve this goal, academic texts will be analyzed so as to promote the awareness of global and local rhetorical strategies used by the authors. For writing practice, the primary focus will be on paragraph-level writing. Five major rhetorical, thinking patterns will be introduced and practiced, including cause, effect, comparison, contrast, and argument. Cohesive devices that cue for these patterns will also be attended to.\n\n**II. Content**:\n\nTextual strategies: identifying/analyzing audience, promoting audience awareness, setting writing goals/purposes, working on topic sentences, supporting topic sentences, establishing global and local coherence by making cohesive ties explicit, organizing ideas in enumeration, and maintaining paragraph unity by elucidating topic relevance.\n\nGeneral writing strategies: Generating ideas through brainstorming, surveying, and discussion in the classroom; outlining, drafting, getting feedback from peers, revising, and editing.\n\n**III. Class Policies:**\n\n1\\. Students are expected to attend each class—attendance will be taken. Multiple absences may result in an automatic failing grade.\n\n2\\.
