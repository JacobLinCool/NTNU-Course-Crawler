    "description": "In Freshman English, our course goals are as follows: (1) to introduce students to readings on a wide variety of themes; (2) to guide students how to think critically about the issues addressed in the readings; (3) to discuss, in English, these issues; (4) to help students become familiar with new vocabulary and aspects of Western culture, and discuss how they are used in the readings; and (5) to prepare students to be able to paraphrase passages from the readings and answer essay questions related to the readings. \n\nThe course, Freshman English for English majors, has several goals: \n \n1.      To introduce students to the basic and necessary reading skills that students will need to employ throughout their lives when reading or discussing materials that have been written in English.\n \n2.      To teach students to think critically about the issues addressed in the readings. \n \n3.      To provide classroom opportunities for the discussion of thoughts and ideas generated from students’ use of critical thinking skills.\n \n4.      To provide opportunities through the use of homework to allow students to show their understanding of the readings’ main ideas, supporting examples, vocabulary, idioms, phrases, the use of inference, and paragraph and essay construction. \n \n5.      To prepare students to be able to paraphrase passages from the readings, write summaries of the readings, and answer essay questions related to the readings.  \n \n6.     To provide students with opportunities to read essays or other readings which provide greater exposure and deeper understanding on topics of global interest.",
