    "syllabus": "**Course description**\n\nThis course is to help students develop their knowledge of particular writing genres and apply it to real-world situations. They will be particularly oriented to writing short stories, writing essay examinations, and writing in different disciplines. In addition, they will learn to develop their writing competency in the use of collocations through collocation exercises and tools. It is intended that while the students apply these tools to writing assignments, they can hone their writing skills by writing particular essays, reviewing their peers’ essays, and making major revisions.  \n\nFor details, please check out the [syllabus](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=41b2833168154aa5999d797b7a94a86a&fno=5904fc985d8b4c6287699ee55206aea1).",
