Besides a comprehensive historical survey of these theories, students will be required to read, discuss, and critique some representative theoretical texts in detail and to develop accurate, critical understanding of such essential concepts as reification, ideological interpellation, the unconscious, the ego-superego-id structure, drive, Panopticon, simulacrum, to name only a few. Some cinematic and literary texts will be analyzed in light of these theoretical concepts.",
