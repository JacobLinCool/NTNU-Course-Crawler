    "description": "Population genetics is a discipline of genetics that study the mechanism of gene frequency changes through time in a population and among populations.  It is the fundamental basis of biological evolution. It also has been widely applied to the field of medicine and agriculture. This course is aimed to introduce basic concept of population genetics from causes of gene frequency changes to molecular evolution and population genomics. This course should provide a solid base for other special topics in evolutionary biology and conservation, such as conservation genetics, molecular evolution, and evolutionary genomics.",
