    "description": "This course is designed to introduce students to fundamental physical concepts and their applications in Astronomy. Although this course will cover a wide range of astrophysics, it will be kept close to practical consideration.  The study of astronomical objects, that are planets, stars, galaxies and the Universe itself, require a good understanding of the fundamental physics, from the classical concepts to the modern ones.   This course will provide an overview of the basics in Physics and how it is applied to understand Astronomy. Qualitative lectures will be supported by quantitative exercise during the lectures and under the form of homework. Midterm and final exams will assess the work of the students.",
