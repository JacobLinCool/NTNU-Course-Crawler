    "description": "This course will be an introduction to mineral resources, their classification, genesis and distribution in time and space. Important global resources will be examined and discussed through independent term projects. Topics will focus the different processes which specific ore-deposits form. The course is structured into four parts which cover the majority of ore-deposits on Earth. The first part will focus on magmatic-related ore-deposits. The second part will discuss hydrothermal-related ore-deposits. The third part will focus on sedimentary-related ore-deposits. The final part will contextualize ore-deposits into a greater global tectonic framework.",
