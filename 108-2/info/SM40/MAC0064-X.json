    "description": "In this one-semester course we will introduce the symmetric functions. Symmetric function plays a core topic in modern enumerative and algebraic combinatorics.  \nTopics to be covered:\n1. Symmetric functions\n2. Various basis\n3. Hall product\n4. Tableaux and skew tableaux\n5. RSK algorithm\n6. Plane partitions\n7. Connections with representation theory and others",

    "syllabus": "In this one-semester course we will introduce Coxeter combinatorics, focusing on Eulerian numbers, permutations and other connections. We will cover most of the following topics:\n\nEulerian numbers/ Coxeter groups/ Coxeter complex/ Catalan numbers/ Narayana numbers/ Euler numbers/ permutations statistics/ paper reading\n\nIf time allowed, we will introduce some basic concepts in combinatorial topology. \n\nEach week students are required to lecture a portion of the assigned topic alternatively, with set of exercises. In final weeks each student will be assigned a research paper to read and report.\n\n\\[Notice for the Wuhan-epidemic\\]\n\nTo cope with the 16-week semester, our space will somewhat accelerate. Some materials will be assigned as \"self study\".\n\nIn-class discussions and presentation are required, no prerequisite is required.",
