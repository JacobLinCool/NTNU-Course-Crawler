    "syllabus": "**General English II - Upper-Intermediate - Spring 2020**\n\n**Objectives**: This course is designed to support college freshmen’s in their use of English language in academic context and to **improve their output proficiency****.** This semester the class concentrates on **build****ing** **students’ proficiency** **in** **speaking and writing** through activities that integrate the four language skills. Therefore, the main objectives of this class will be to develop students’ **(1)** fluency in expressing ideas in oral and written forms in English, **(2)** English presentation skills, and **(3)** autonomous learning skills. In order to do so, there is a **five-pronged approach** to the course:\n\n**1)** Firstly, **the course textbook** emphasizes vocabulary learning and building in order to provide students the structure and tools to acquire new words. Furthermore, the textbook helps improve reading proficiency and develop practical critical thinking.\n\n**2)** Secondly, over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake one major **task-based presentation project (ppt)**, in which task groups, of no more than 3 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are **of serious interest to themselves**, and then **present their work** to the class.\n\n**3) Thirdly,** students are expected to read extensively to improve your English reading especially **Lexile books.** There will be a **Lexile test** in both semesters to assess any improvement.\n\n**4) Fourthly,** students will need to do at least **15 hours of autonomous learning** in total this semester (an hour a week), which must be proven for grading.\n\n**5) Fifth of all**, there will be a **writing workshop** after which students will be asked to write **two reviews and a short critical essay** based on class work, while there will also be four **Chapter Reviews** to quiz student comprehension.\n\n**6)** Due to the **coronavirus outbreak**, two classes have to be made up.
