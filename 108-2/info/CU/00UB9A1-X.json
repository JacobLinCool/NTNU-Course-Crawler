    "syllabus": "**English III: Literature and Culture - Spring 2020**\n\n**“**What is important now is to recover our senses. We must learn to see more, to hear more, to feel more. Our  task  is  not  to  find  the  maximum amount  of  content  in  a  work  of  art,  much  less  to squeeze more content out of the work than is already there. Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all. The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art—and, by analogy, our own experience—more, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is rather than to show what it means. In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.”\n\n\\-       from “Beyond Interpretation” by Susan Sontag\n\n([www.academia.edu/39160786/\\_Susan\\_Sontag\\_Against\\_interpretation\\_and\\_other\\_es\\_BookZZ.org\\_](http://www.academia.edu/39160786/_Susan_Sontag_Against_interpretation_and_other_es_BookZZ.org_))\n\n**Objectives:** This course is designed to **introduce** students to **acclaimed literature** from all around the world. The overall aim is to help students become **more critical readers** by **analysing several texts** and **learning some essential literary terms and devices**. At the same time, we will **delve into the cultures** that we meet along the way in an effort to **better understand the readings** we encounter. A major focus will also be on **improving student fluency** in expressing their ideas **both orally and in written forms in English**. Hence, there will be a three-pronged approach to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** this is **a flip class.** There will be **short readings in the form of quotes and acclaimed short stories** which students **must read** for homework before they come to class. Each of these readings will be analysed and discussed in the following class. Student understanding of these texts **will be tested** at the very end of the semester.\n\n**3) Secondly,** you will be asked to join a **book club group** to read and analyse a book/novel of their choice and then **give a presentation** on it at the end of the course.\n\n**4) Finally**, students will be tasked to show what they have learned in class by **writing** **a book review**, **a movie review** and **a short critical essay,** the latter based on the readings done in class.\n\n**NB:** All elements of the course will be evaluated and assessed for the final grade.\n\n**Textbook:** The quotes and readings will be provided by the teacher through handouts, online and/or via our moodle page. **The only book/novel that will need to be acquired will be the one chosen by your book club.**\n\n**Online material:** literatureandhistory.com, moodle2.ntnu.edu.tw/ ([1081英文（三）：文學與文化](https://moodle2.ntnu.edu.tw/course/view.php?id=16981))\n\n**Materials:** A **notebook** is recommended for taking notes and doing assignments.\n\n**Schedule:** This is a tentative schedule and may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion. \n\nWk\n\nDate\n\nContent\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n3/6\n\n   Introduction and Orientation\n-------------------------------\n\n**Choose a kid’s book**\n\n2\n\n3/13\n\n1.  _Reading 1_\n2.
