    "syllabus": " **_English II (for majors in sports)_**\n\nSpring, 2020\n\n**Course Objective**\n\nThis course aims to teach students how to use the tools and resources available to them to do English tasks such as reading aloud a paragraph, understanding an article, role playing an everyday situation, introducing themselves and their majors, teaching people how to learn the skills they are good at, expressing their opinions, taking notes, writing resumes, autobiographies and well-organized essays, etc. Students will be offered lots of opportunities to develop the four language skills along with critical thinking skills through a wide variety of in-class and out-of-class activities.\n\n**Textbook**\n\n_World Class Readings 1: A Reading Skills Text_\n\n**Requirements and Rules**\n\n1.  **Punctual attendance**, **lesson preparation** and **active participation** are required. Participation also includes teamwork and group discussion.\n\n*   All student absences will be classified as excused or unexcused.\n*   Absences for the following reasons will be _excused_ if there is timely verification (within 1 week) of such reasons provided to the instructor:\n\n*   Illness or medical emergency\n*   Family emergencies\n*   Pre-arranged medical appointments.\n*   Pre-arranged school-sponsored activities, such as field trips.\n\n*   A Notification of Absence Form has to be submitted online (學生請假系統) within 1 week. Verification document (hard-copy) should also be handed in to the instructor within 1 week. Late submission will not be accepted. A Notification of Absence Form without a verified document will be regarded as an _unexcused_ absence.\n*   Students who are more than 30 minutes late to class will be considered absent.\n*   Students will fail this course if there are more than 3 unexcused absences.\n*   Students will fail this course if they miss more than 5 meetings the whole semester.\n\n1.  **Plagiarism and cheating on quizzes or exams** is absolutely forbidden. If someone is found cheating on an assignment or an exam, he/she will fail that task.\n\n1.  **Textbook** is a must. Violation of this rule will cost you 2 points (out of your final score) each time.\n\n1.  You cannot use your smart phone to do things irrelevant with the teacher’s instructions. Violation of this rule will cost you 2 points each time.\n\n1.  Before every meeting, you should preview the reading. Look up the words that you don’t know in the dictionary. You might be asked in class what the word means. If you can’t answer correctly, one point will be deducted each time. I’ll also check whether you’ve done the exercise in the reading. If you haven’t, then one point will be deducted from your final score.\n\n1.  The whole class will be divided into 6 groups. Each group picks one person who is competent and responsible to be their leader. In every meeting, the leader checks whether his group members have looked up the new words in the reading. Then they try to work out the answers to the exercise and discuss the reading together. After that, the teacher randomly selects some students to read aloud or translate the text and answer the comprehension questions. Some follow-up questions will be raised for further discussion. Each discussion session will last 15 minutes. Exchange your opinions within your group and contribute your ideas. Each time the group must assign at least one member to **give an oral report** of their discussion. After the oral report, the reporter must hand in a written report. It must contain at least 100 words and it must be well organized.\n\n1.  A speaking activity – **Sports Celebrity Interview** \\-- will be held on 06/05. Two people work as a pair. One of them plays the role as an interviewer, and the other, as a very famous athlete. The interview must be done in English and last at least 2 minutes. The longer, the better. You are encouraged to use multimedia and all kinds of resources (props, costumes, photos, etc.) to make your interview interesting. Please submit your script a week before your presentation.\n\n1.  Everyone must take the **Lexile Online Reading Comprehension Test** in May. The score you get will constitute 5% of your final score.\n\n1.  A midterm speaking activity – **Talent** **Show** \\-- will be held on 4/24. It’s a group work. People with the same or similar specialties work together. They use English to introduce and demonstrate their specialties to the class. Think about how to make your show interesting to a layman. If there are 6 people in the group, then the show time should be at least 12 minutes. Everyone must speak for some time so that they can get the credit.\n\n1.  **Reading and Discussion Project**\n\nIn order to improve students’ extensive reading and discussion skills, one Lexile book will be assigned as an outside reading for them to practice discussing on 03/27. Before the event, the teacher will briefly introduce the essence of quality talk and the most frequently used 6 types of questions. Each student must try to ask as many questions as possible, proving that they really understand how to ask questions in order to elicit important information and stimulate further thoughts. They write down their questions on a paper before coming to class. In class, they take turns asking their group members the questions. While doing the task, they work together, thinking about which questions are important and inspiring enough to be included. After that, they hand in a paper with all the questions fitting the 6 categories and their answers on it. This assignment constitutes 5 points and is due on 04/10. Then each student writes down his/her thought about the book on an A4 paper and submit it to me on 04/17. This will constitute another 5 points.\n\n1.  **Check Moodle 2.8 and email frequently**\n\nI assume that you check your email and the course site frequently. It’s your responsibility to make sure you register with the correct email address on Moodle 2.8. **Not receiving a notice is NOT an excuse for any late submission. Late submission will be penalized 10% per day.**\n\n**Grading Policies**\n\nAttendance and Participation                                                 10%\n\nLexile Test (in May)                                                                  5%\n\nAn Oral Report of Your Group Discussion & a Written Essay      10%\n\nSports Celebrity Interview (06/05)                                               10%\n\nQuestioning Skills and Reflection of a Book                                10%\n\nTalent Show (04/24)                                                                        20%\n\nQuizzes of the Five Readings                                   20%\n\nFinal Exam (06/19)                                                                        20%\n\n**Bonus Points (for those who can’t get 60 points in the quizzes and final exam)**\n\n1.
