    "description": "This course aims to explore the making of European identity through a set of images, practices, visual forms, etc. Europeans have historically created in order to represent the Other. Privileging some areas (Asia) and some manners of appropriation (the narrative; the symbolic emblem) over others, Europeans have conceptualized otherness as an alternative manner of self-definition (“I am what I am because of what I am not”) from the very early dawn of classical civilization. By reviewing some of the most momentous encounters and far-reaching narratives, we will attempt to tease out their meaning and plot it against some of the most influential late 20th century theories of otherness.",
