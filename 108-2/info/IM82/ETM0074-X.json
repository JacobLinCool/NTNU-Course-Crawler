    "description": "Media, from early print to the internet and from the days of Murray and Cook to the digital age, has played a highly instrumental role in the shaping of modern tourism, and identifying aspects of this role is the main purpose of this course. In terms of both its content and teaching strategy —which includes, among others, offering access to students to a wide variety of materials, printed, visual (photos, silent films, propaganda and ads, etc.), multimedia, etc.—the course emphasizes active student participation and involvement (analysis, connection to present-day practices, etc.).",
    "goals": [
        "- to review some of the essential developments in the history of tourism up to the present day in relation to media",
        "- to reveal the intimate interactions (negotiations, adaptations, conversions) created, in the early days as now, between media and tourism",
        "- to strengthen the students’ abilities to approach contemporary media developments (as they relate to tourism) through accurate critical lenses."
