    "description": "This course describes various physical, radiative, dynamical processes involved in the earth’s climate system. In particular, it will emphasize the importance of climate dynamics in explaining the current research areas such as ENSO dynamics, Arctic oscillation, and effects of global warming on monsoons. In this course, active discussions on some influential journal articles are an important part by which students will acquire updated information regarding various aspects of climate change research.",
