    "description": "Students will gain an appreciation of prose literature in English, broaden related contextual knowledge, and improve their English comprehension and critical thinking. Students will be introduced to methods of “close-reading” whereby they will understand the elements of English writing style. This will be done through reading famous works of English fiction and non-fiction writing in long and short form along with a basic introduction to the terminology used when discussing fiction and non-fiction works in English. The class will include group discussions on the selected prose where free interpretation and critical opinion is encouraged and practiced.",
