    "description": "The primary goal of this course is aimed at enhancing participants` capacity for problem identification, issue analysis, strategy developing, and decision making with respect to brand management. Students will learn why and how brands could be (for the start-ups) and have been (for quite a few incumbents) the most invaluable intangible assets. Students will also learn how marketers may create the brand equity, how the brand equity is measured, and how the brand equity can be sustained by capturing the ongoing business opportunities. It is expected that students will be able to develop a relatively structured framework to identify the core issues relevant to brands, and to initiate the unique marketing strategies to cope with the branding issues.",
