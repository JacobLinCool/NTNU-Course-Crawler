    "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introductory history of western art and its literary reception. Each week we will be looking at a different work of visual art and discussing it with reference to (1) its own cultural context and (2) a short literary text written in response or as a complement to it. The course will, in the main, follow the chronology of the works of visual art that we will be considering, which means we will range from medieval to modern/contemporary periods of artistic production; the literary texts we will be looking at are mostly poems from the twentieth century. I have tried to exclude extremely obscure texts. Students on this course will always be encouraged to try out their own interpretations of works of visual art and literary texts alike.",
