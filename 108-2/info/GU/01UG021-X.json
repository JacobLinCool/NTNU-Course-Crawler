Therefore, even though the course is taught in English, students are required to have good reading, speaking, and listening proficiency in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nThis interdisciplinary program focuses on disparate critical concepts and themes to facilitate students a preliminary study of literature and film. Films and literary works explored in this course range from film adaptations of literary masterpieces, films of critical sociological, cultural, and literary concern, and the written texts of literary works proper. By guiding them into undertaking in-depth, critical analysis of representations of the visual and the verbal, this course aims to broaden students’ worldview and hence their humanistic vision. It is hope that by the end of the semester, students will acquire the comprehensive knowledge of literature and film with the aid of a thorough grasp of cultural and historical contexts; meanwhile, by analyzing literary works and their film adaptations, students may compare different ways of representations in cinematic and written texts. We hope to draw more students’ interest back to literature by watching films; on the other hand, we also expect students to be more critically aware of the lure of contemporary media and therefore are able to see film adaptations of literary works as socio-cultural processes involving issues of representation, production, and consumption.\n\n**二、教學大綱**（任課教師可異動部分）**Tentative** Course schedule\n\n**授課教師**\n\n(teacher)\n\n蘇榕\n\n**教學進度與主題**（可說明每週進度）\n\n(Teaching Content including topics of each week)\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nAssigned Reading**/**Class Activities\n\nTheme\n\n1\n\n3/05\n\nOrientation; “What is Plagiarism?”\n\nIntroduction to the course and\n\nrequirements\n\n2\n\n3/12\n\n_The Remains of the Day_\n\nAging and Retrospection\n\n3\n\n 3/19\n\n_The Remains of the Day_\n\nAging and Retrospection\n\n4\n\n3/26\n\n_Go Grandriders_\n\nEnjoying the Senior Age\n\n5\n\n4/02\n\nSpring break\n\n(Observed Holiday)\n\nThe School is closed for one day.
