    "description": "Data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amounts of data stored either in databases, data warehouses, or other form of information repositories. The discovered knowledge may be known factual patterns, or may be knowledge, constraints, rules that have not yet been known. The goals of this course lie in introducing the concepts and framework of data mining, various data mining techniques, and data mining’s application in library and information science, and Internet.",
