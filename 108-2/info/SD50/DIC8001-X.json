    "description": "This course aims to provide students with rigorous training related to ecology and conservation. The course will cover the following topics: \n\n1.Structure and function of community and ecosystem:\n   Interactions between physical setting and biological components\n   Driving forces of ecosystem\n2.Habitat requirement of non- human keystone species in ecosystem \n   Identification and characterization of habitat required by species through its life history \n3.Key processes related to ecosystem structure and function\n   Net primary production\n   Biogeochemistry\n   Ecosystem stability, resistance and resilience\n4.Conservation of ecosystem\n   Global warming threat and human responses and adjustments \n   Characterizing ecosystem or habitat that needs for maintenance, wise use, or restoration practices (case studies) in conserving ecosystems\n5.Ecological services and valuation of ecosystem: From structure, function, and services of ecosystem to human well-being\n\nSelected readings that represent major advancement in ecology and conservation and related to the above topics will be given to students for in depth discussion. Professor(s) will give brief lectures on the topics and lead the discussion for approximately one quarter of the semester and students will lead the discussion for the rest. Through the discussion each student is expected to develop a review essay as a term paper. Questions and solutions raised in the discussions are expected to make major contributions in ecology and conservation. Novel approaches and inter-disciplinary studies are highly encouraged.",
    "goals": [
        "Lectures and assigned readings are designed to provide fundamental knowledge in ecology and conservation.",
        "Students will identify an area of interest and come up with a research proposal that aims to answer an outstanding question in that area."
