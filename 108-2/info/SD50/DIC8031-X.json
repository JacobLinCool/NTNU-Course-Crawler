All lectures will be taught in English. \n\nSome lectures are focused around the theories behind a topic (how does genome assembly work?), whereas others focus around a question (why are we interested in this?). Strong emphasis are placed around evolutionary and ecological genomic topics in non-model organisms (i.e., non-human).\n\nTarget audiences are NTNU-TIGP students, NTU-GSB students who handed in work on time, or any postgraduate students who have sequencing data from non-model organisms but everyone in your lab including your PI have no idea about how to do with them. \n\nDepending on the number and ability of students I may tailor week12-16 to include more advanced practical or even let students to try real time sequencing using MinION."
