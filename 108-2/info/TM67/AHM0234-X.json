    "description": "Concerning its form and function, the altarpiece was always closely connected with the focal point of every church, the altar. As a consequence, it played a key role in Christian liturgy and devotion since its emergence in the High Middle Ages. The course will provide an overview of the cultural background and the multifarious functions of the altarpiece from the earliest examples to late manifestations in Romanticism. Case studies will be used to follow formal development and characteristics and the different aspects of use. A special focus will be laid on the periods of transition and radical change, such as the Reformation and Counter-Reformation as well as the Enlightenment.",
