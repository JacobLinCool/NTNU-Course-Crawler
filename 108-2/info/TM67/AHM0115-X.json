It includes the essential bibliography mentioning monographs, academic studies, articles, documents, archives, and/or critics related to the topic. It provides the list of works (illustrations) analyzed during the lesson\n\nEach session tends to tackle a specific issue. Its goal is to present, analyze, and discuss the most important theoretical and practical aspects related to the topic in question. The outlines and the main issues are introduced at the beginning of each lesson. A brief summary of the previous lesson introduces the new issues which will be discussed. If questions related to previous lessons are still pending, they are answered, and/or recontextualized.\n\nThe topics are addressed through a close reading and detailed analysis of a single, or a group of works of art. The main issues related to a subject are examined through concrete examples. Different points of view are privileged in order to open new perspectives on well or-less known objects. I select various scientific texts, documents and sources and comment on them. Images, texts, and documents are used in order to present original and critical approaches.\n\nStudents’ abilities to gather, investigate and analyze art history resources are trained through personal contributions, such as the essays they are asked to present orally during the semester, and complete in a 10-page length written paper by the end of the semester. The topics are carefully chosen in order to propose issues that are closely related to the main topic of the course. Their relevance depends also on their accessibility. When selecting the topics I always take into account the literature at disposition. The students are in this respect given a selected bibliography which helps them to access the topic with the most appropriate tools. Students are also asked to complete their research with other readings.",

They are trained in the observation of artworks. They are taught how to describe a work (from the more general to the more specific), to understand its structure, its content, and its meaning. They are asked to compare works (or documents) with similar or contradictory examples. They are taught to identify and to interpret the different meanings of a work. Their aesthetic sensitivity and their critical thinking are encouraged through an acute observation and analysis of the works, documents, and academic writings introduced throughout the course. If the content presented seems to be unclear to the students, it is clarified through questions and answers."
