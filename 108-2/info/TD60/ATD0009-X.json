In the spirit of MOOCS, we require students to read some assigned readings, watch some assigned free online videos, and discuss what they have learned or raise questions in class. Except lecturing and in-class discussions, this course also includes a few fieldtrips, a mid-term oral presentation, a final report on their artwork based on an assigned theme, and a written report on gallery visit(s).\n\n**Requirements**:\n\n\\*閱讀指定讀本、影音資料、課堂口頭報告、老師講評提問。\n\n\\*積極參與課堂討論、報告、參訪、期末藝展等，以上均列入評分。\n\n\\*期中口頭報告PPT（15-20分）、期末口頭報告PPT（20-25分）與提交成品、英文書面報告（參訪心得）。\n\n**Grading Policy**:\n\n\\*20%: Class Participation  (e.g. discussion, attendance, presentation, etc.)\n\n\\*30%: Midterm: A 15-20-minute oral presentation\n\n\\*40%: Final: A 20-25-minute oral presentation\n\n\\*10%: A written report on your gallery visit(s)\n\n**A Tentative Syllabus****：**\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nTheme\n\nNote\n\n1\n\n3/05\n\nCourse orientation\n\nDistribution of oral presentations and explanation about the assigned theme for your final report\n\n \n\n2\n\n3/12\n\nCharles Baudelaire (Selected readings)\n\nOral presentation: case study\\*\n\n\\*The presentation should be based on a critical review of a renowned painter or an art theory; each presentation will be followed by the instructor’s comments and group discussion.\n\n3\n\n3/19\n\nCharles Baudelaire (continued.)\n\nOral presentation: case study\n\nDitto.\n\n4\n\n3/26\n\nWalter Benjamin (Selected readings)\n\nOral presentation: case study\n\nDitto.\n\n5\n\n4/02\n\nSpring break\n\n(Observed Holiday)\n\nNo class meeting for this day.\n\n6\n\n4/09\n\nWalter Benjamin (continued.)\n\nOral presentation: case study\n\nDitto.\n\n7\n\n4/16\n\nOral presentation: case study\n\nField Trip (TBA)\n\nDitto.\n\n8\n\n4/23\n\nOral presentation: case study\n\nField Trip (TBA)\n\nDitto.\n\n9\n\n4/30\n\nOral presentation: case study\n\nField Trip (TBA)\n\nDitto.\n\n10\n\n5/07\n\nFinal report (Theme: Isolation/Insulation/interstice/Suture)\n\n\\*Create an artwork based on the assigned theme by offering an explanatory note.\n\nEach report will be followed by the instructor’s comments and group discussion.\n\n11\n\n5/14\n\nFinal report (Theme: Isolation/Insulation/interstice/Suture)\n\nDitto.\n\n12\n\n5/21\n\nFinal report (Theme: Isolation/Insulation/interstice/Suture)\n\nDitto.\n\n13\n\n5/28\n\nFinal report (Theme: Isolation/Insulation/interstice/Suture)\n\nDitto.\n\n14\n\n6/04\n\nFinal report (Theme: Isolation/Insulation/interstice/Suture)\n\nDitto.\n\n15\n\n6/11\n\nFinal report (Theme: Isolation/Insulation/interstice/Suture)\n\nDitto.\n\n16\n\n**6/18**\n\n**End of the semester:** recapitulation\n\nEnd of the course.\n\n\\*17\n\nOnline submission\n\n\\***Flexible course arrangement**\n\n\\*Please upload your written report on gallery visit(s) onto Moodle.\n\n\\*Online submission due by the 13th week.\n\n\\*18\n\nOnline consultation\n\n**\\*Flexible course arrangement**\n\nOnline Individual Conference\n\n**\\***Please register for the conference by the 12th week in Moodle.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nBaudelaire, Charles.  _The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays_.  Trans.  Jonathan Mayne.  1964.  London: Phaidon, 1995.\n\nBenjamin, Walter.
