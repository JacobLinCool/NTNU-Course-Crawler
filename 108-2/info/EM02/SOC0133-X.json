    "description": "This seminar is designed to provide a foundational overview of theories and research on e-learning. Topics to be covered include the differences between traditional learning and e-learning, game-based learning, mobile learning, as well as several seminars regarding eye-tracking technique and robotics. To maximize the benefit that students get from the seminar, students will be required to complete a review regarding weekly topics before class. Aside from weekly readings, students will engage in guided in-class activities and discussions. Also, to cultivate students’ ability to raise an issue, address a research question, and develop a research proposal, at the end of the semester, a mini-conference activity will be built into the course.",

If you participate in class discussions 10 times thorough the whole semester, you will get 10 points."
