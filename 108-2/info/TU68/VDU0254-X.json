    "syllabus": "課程簡紹\n\nExplore the idea of innovation design by acquiring professional knowledge of design industries to learn the design technologies and processes and apply design thinking to develop an innovative design. \n\n  \n課程目標\n\n1.  Acknowledge the design process and technology to develop innovation in design\n2.  Enrich the basic knowledge in design from different scale and discipline\n3.  Cultivate wide range of design concept for innovation design\n4.  Develop the skill of solving problems in design field\n\n  \n教學進度與主題\n\nThis class seeks the idea of innovation in design in different scales from product to space by applying the design thinking method. The enrolled students start with an investigation for defining what is an innovative design by looking through different types of design. The first assignment is Hybrid Design, which combines different functions to create innovative design solutions for certain issues that students raise based on their research. It could be a small product or bigger scale as furniture. The second theme is Adaptable Space Use, which can be outdoor furniture or interior space functional conversion or addition in some location of NTNU campus. Students spend roughly six weeks to develop their research and design and make the final presentation to determine the grade.  \n  \n  \n教學進度與主題        (1) Hybrid Design\n\n                                 (2) Adaptable Space Use\n\n毎週進度\n\n週次                上課日期        課程進度、内容、主題\n\n1                      3/5                  第一週課程紹介。(1) Hybrid Design introduction\n\n2                      3/12                Students design research presentation (PPT 10-15 min per)\n\n3                      3/19                Students design concept and sketch development\n\n4                      3/26                Students model development\n\n5                      4/2                  The design concept and model presentation (P1-1)\n\n6                      4/9                  Individual desk critic and model adjustment\n\n7                      4/16                \"Future Ordinary\" Lecture I\n\n8                      4/23                First theme final presentation (P1-Final)\n\n9                      4/30                \"Future Ordinary\" Lecture II\n\n10                    5/7                  Second assignment (2) Adaptable Space Use\n\n11                    5/14                Site and space usage presentation (PPT 10-15 min per)\n\n12                    5/21                Student design concept and sketch development\n\n13                    5/28                The design concept and model presentation (P2-1)\n\n14                    6/4                  Finalize the design concept and model\n\n15                    6/11                Second theme final presentation (P2-Final)\n\n16                    6/18                Semester portfolio report, exhibition and grading\n\n17                    6/25",
