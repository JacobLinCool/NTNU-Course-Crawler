    "description": "The objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming languages with a special focus on its application in linguistic analyses. This course is especially tailored to those who do not have any background or experiences in coding. We will start from the very basic concepts, such as data types, variable assignments, control structures, to more complex procedures such as routines, functions, and other exploratory project-based tasks. The course consists of a series of theme-based hands-on tutorials, which demonstrate how the flexibility of the programming language can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. Specifically, this course will use the language R as our featuring programming language and introduce you to R, Rstudio, and a collection of R packages designed to work together to make linguistic analyses fast, fluent, and fun. By the end of the course, students should have a working knowledge of coding and an initial ability to advance a project independently as a data scientist.",
