    "description": "This course is offered as a complement to the Theory/Cultural Studies course now required of incoming graduate students in Literature, and is intended as a review of English, British, and American literary history for graduate students. The course emphasizes the value of analyzing works of literature as the products of specific cultures in the past. This review is intended to serve as a foundation for future decisions about which aspect/era/genre/specialty students will focus on in their graduate work. The syllabus and readings will be determined by the individual instructor, and may include guest lecturers on each period; the readings will include highlights of English, British, and American literature and cover a range of periods and genres, from medieval times to modern, with an overview of pre-nineteenth-century periods and greater emphasis on the nineteenth century and after. As a complete survey of English and American literature in one semester is impractical, the course aims to introduce students to texts that highlight the most compelling issues of each period. Furthermore, so as to stimulate students into finding innovative topics and approaches in their own research, this course draws attention to recent historicist scholarship and, more specifically, scholarship emphasizing the ways in which the literature of the past has been mediated by or in some sense revisited in later periods. Thematic cohesion is also provided by the attention given throughout the course to changing representations of gender, sexuality, motherhood, marriage, race, and the idea of a national literature.",
