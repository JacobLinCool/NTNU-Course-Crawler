    "description": "Since its inception in the 1960s, Asian American studies has taken on a journey of self-transformations. From the era of “claiming America” in the 1990s to that of “returning Asia” in the millennial, the loops between and across Asia and America have opened up for further deliberations and alternative mappings. Within the wide spectrum, this seminar will focus on two contingencies —the emergence of Taiwanese American voices and the perpetuation of Filipino American diasporas. In the first half of the course, we will examine Taiwanese American expressions—from the ABC soap opera, Fresh Off the Boat (since 2015), the writer Eddie Huang (2013), the lead actress Constance Wu, who also stars in Crazy Rich Asians (2018), to the award-winning novel Green Island (Shawna Yang Ryan, 2016). For the second part, we will revisit the experiences of Filipino Americans—from the Manila men in Louisiana in the 1750s to the Filipino Overseas Workers (FOW’s) in the age of globalization. It aims to give students a critical introduction to Asian American entanglements, including the historical context, the current development, and the representative texts. By putting together graphics, films, and novels, we will examine Asian American texts from Chinese, Filipino, Singaporean, and Taiwanese backgrounds. It also highlights two guest speakers—Prof. David Leiwei Li (李磊偉; U of Oregon) and Prof. Shu-mei Shih (史書美; UCLA). Students are also encouraged to attend the Asian American/Asian British Literary and Cultural Studies International Conference during June 9-10 at Academia Sinica (AS). A Google reader of selected critical essays will be made available.",
