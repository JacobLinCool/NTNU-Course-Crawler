    "description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to a range of texts from the fields of literary theory and cultural studies. Besides offering them some methodological co-ordinates for their own future research and training them in techniques of discussing and writing clearly about complex ideas, the course is designed to stimulate students’ critical thinking. In particular, it is hoped that they will learn to reflect sceptically on the dominant cultural values of their own society and educational culture as a result of their close reading of essays and other works that bring into focus some of the most egregious products of stupefaction issuing from the west.",
