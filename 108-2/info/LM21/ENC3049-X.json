The process of identifying and deciding ways to collect data is one of the most difficult steps for graduate students in conducting second- or foreign-language research. Throughout this course, students will gain a clearer understanding of which data elicitation techniques may be most appropriate in a given research domain, and gain better insight into the strength and weakness of major data collection methods used in the field. The research elicitation methods covered in this course include the most frequently used research protocols used in psycholinguistic, UG-based approaches, interaction, classroom, and survey-based SLA research, as well as research in cognitive processes and strategies.",
