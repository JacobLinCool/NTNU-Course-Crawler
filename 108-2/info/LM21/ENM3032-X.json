Topics such as definitions of creativity, psychology of creativity, language play, teaching for creativity and creative L2 pedagogy will be explored in this course. Students will also learn to apply the principles of creativity to design ELT tasks that can stimulate learner creativity.\n\n*   **Course Objectives:**\n\n1.  Students will become familiar with the theories and principles of creativity.\n2.  Students will understand the role of creativity in foreign language teaching and learning.\n3.  Students can apply the theories and principles of creativity to design language tasks.\n\n*   **Delivery of instruction:**\n\n1.  Lecture\n2.  Group discussion & cooperation\n3.  Student presentation\n\n*   **Grading Policy & Course Requirements:**\n\n**1.     Grading Policy:**\n\n    (1) Attendance/participation: 20%\n\n    (2) Oral presentation: 15%\n\n    (3) Assignments: 25%\n\n    (4) Research proposal: 40%\n\n**2.    Course requirements**\n\nClass attendance is a fundamental requirement that will be strictly enforced in this course. Students are required to come to class every week. Except for a hospitalized emergency (medical proof needed) or an authorized absence, absence from each class period will result in a 1.5-point deduction from students’ attendance/participation score. Arriving late to class or leaving early will count as an absence.\n\nEach student will be responsible for presenting 1–2 research articles selected from the reading list.\n\n**(3) Assignments (25%)**\n\n(A) **Activity design (15%):** Students will work in pairs to design and demonstrate a creative ELT activity based on a unit selected from a junior/senior high school English textbook. Besides demonstrating the activity in class, they also need to submit a group report (3-4 pages) that clearly states the design of this activity and the rationale behind it based on the theories and principles of creativity they learn in this course.\n\n(B) **Reading reflective reports (10%):** Students have to hand in two “one-page” reading reflective reports in this semester. This reading assignment is to encourage students to explore new teaching ideas. For each report, students have to find an outside reading material related to creativity (e.g., articles in journals, newspapers, and magazines), and reflect upon what they have learned from the article.\n\n*   **late assignments will be marked down by 30%. Once they are two or more days late, they will NOT be accepted under any circumstances.**\n\n   **(4) Research Proposal (including proposal presentation and final written report) (40%)**  \n\nEach student has to complete a research proposal that addresses an important issue of creativity in foreign language teaching and learning.\n\n**3\\.
