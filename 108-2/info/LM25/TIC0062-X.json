Throughout the course, we will watch some films related to translator/interpreters and look at how a film can travel around the world and become accessible and intelligible to other cultures. The objective is to help students to see how translation is at work in film production and consumption. Furthermore, it is hoped that the course can sensitize students to the logic of audio/visual/linguistic systems cross different cultures.",
