    "description": "The translation of news and editorials require a specialized format, register and tone. This course will familiarize students with the techniques of translating news into English. Exercises will focus on news articles centering on social, business and political topics, as well as editorials. In the last few weeks of the course, students will learn how to rewrite/summarize news articles based on several Chinese sources.\n\nCourse Objectives \nTo help students learn the techniques for translating Chinese-language news into English.\n\nClasses will be conducted as follows:\n(1) A weekly translation exercise of about 500-1000 characters long. At least 15 exercises during the term. \n(2) Source-language texts will include news articles/editorials centering on social, political and business topics. Handouts or relevant online links will be given to students for prior reading before doing their translation assignments.\n(3) Weekly translation projects submitted by students will be discussed in class, including analysis of mistranslations, omissions, corrections and improvements. \n(4) Emphasis of student-work analysis: accuracy, grammar, diction, vocabulary, tone, language register, style and format. \n(5) Students will be regularly assigned to study and comment on the work of their classmates as a means to learn others’ adopted techniques, as well as consider their pros and cons, in comparison with their own work. \n(6) As a way to develop speed, students will at times be required to do translation of short passages on-site, to be followed by a review of their work. \n(8) Students will sit for their mid-term and final exams. \n(9) Students will be required to compile a glossary of terms based on the assigned exercises, to be submitted by the end of the semester.",
