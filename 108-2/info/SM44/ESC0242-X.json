    "description": "本課程目標在介紹研究所等級之天氣學知識，以了解大氣環流，特別是中緯度綜觀天氣系統之行為。課程內容主要介紹進階之原理與分析方法，以了解並解釋如中緯度氣旋與反氣旋、噴流、鋒面、以及鋒生等現象與天氣系統之演變。同時，本課程也對台灣地區顯著之天氣系統，例如梅雨與颱風進行介紹。除了例行之課堂教學外，本課程包括重要學術論文之選讀與討論，以加強學生未來進行研究之基礎。\nThe objective of this course is to gain an understanding, at the graduate level, of the observed behavior of the atmosphere, with an emphasis on mid-latitude synoptic-scale weather systems. The more advanced analysis techniques and theoretical principles in synoptic-dynamic meteorology will be introduced, and used to help the interpretation of the structure and evolution of systems including extra-tropical cyclones and anti-cyclones, jet/front systems, and frontogenesis in a diagnostic context. The structure and dynamics of significant synoptic to meso-scale weather systems in the Taiwan area, such as Mei-yu fronts and typhoons are also introduced. In addition to regular lectures, selected research papers from the literature will be reviewed and discussed throughout the course.",
