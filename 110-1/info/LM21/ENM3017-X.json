This course addresses L2 issues from an interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional approach and the topics covered revolve around studies focusing on the learners' language and development, on internal and external factors affecting SLA, on studies looking at SLA and learner strategies and styles, and finally, on studies relating to L2 learning in naturalistic and instructed settings. \n\n**Specific Course Objectives**\n\n1.      to provide an introduction to how L2 development have been conceptualized, researched and explained in recent decades.\n\n2.      to consider how scholarly as well as popular theories of language learning underlie language education policy, curriculum and materials development, and classroom practices.\n\n3.      to develop critical thinking skills about scholarly inquiry, theories of language learning, language teaching and our own pedagogical or research practices.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nYou are expected to come to class prepared! **Before** class, you should have done all readings, worked on the homework problems and you should be able to participate fully in the discussions.\n\n1.  In-class participation (40%)\n\n2.  Student-led discussions (40%)\n\n3.  Quizzes (10%)\n\n4.  Attendance (10%)\n\n**Tentative Course Schedule:**\n\n**Session**\n\n**Topic**\n\n**Assigned reading materials**\n\n[Session 1](http://cw.tc.columbia.edu/prometheus/input/outline/weekf.cfm?user_key=3445333&whois=F88EF5EE-1143-3197-60F686AA155A4088&week=1&iruyxd=21365344&lkjrty=92&link=weekview)\n\nOrientation\n\n[Session 2](http://cw.tc.columbia.edu/prometheus/input/outline/weekf.cfm?user_key=3445333&whois=F88EF5EE-1143-3197-60F686AA155A4088&week=2&iruyxd=21365344&lkjrty=92&link=weekview)\n\nTeaching Listening\n\nWagner E., & Toth, P.D.
