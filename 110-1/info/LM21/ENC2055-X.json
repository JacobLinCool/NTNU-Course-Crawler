You are responsible for all material that appears here and should check this page for updates frequently.\n\n*   **2021-06-13**: This course is open to the undergraduates. Please feel free to contact the instructor directly for course enrollment.\n*   **2021-06-07**: For those who are considering taking this course, please read the [FAQ](https://alvinntnu.github.io/NTNU_ENC2055/FAQ.html) first before you make the decision. Thank you very much.\n\n* * *\n\n Course Description\n===================\n\nThe objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming languages with a special focus on its application in linguistic analyses. This course is especially tailored to those who do not have any background or experiences in coding. We will start from the very basic concepts, such as data types, variable assignments, control structures, to more complex procedures such as routines, functions, and other exploratory project-based tasks. The course consists of a series of theme-based hands-on tutorials, which demonstrate how the flexibility of the programming language can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist.\n\nSpecifically, this course will cover coding skills for basic text analytics, including R, Python and shell scripting basics, with the language R being our featuring programming language. We will introduce you to R, Rstudio, and a collection of R packages designed to work together to make linguistic analyses fast, fluent, and fun. Furthermore, we will show you how you can make use of the integrated RStuido for Python and shell scripting. By the end of the course, students should have a working knowledge of coding and an initial ability to advance a project independently as a data scientist.\n\n* * *\n\n Course Schedule\n================\n\n(_This schedule is tentative and subject to change.
