The webcam will not be turned on in class unless necessary.**\n\nCourse Description:\n\nPopulation ageing has been emerging as a global issue ever since the late twentieth century. Japan and other western developed countries foresaw its patent crisis earlier than the rest of the world because population ageing in these countries tends to appear as a slower, gradual process. Accordingly, governments or academia of these countries have more time to ruminate on problems caused by ageing before making policies. The unprecedentedly rapid speed of population ageing in Taiwan, compared with the above areas, strikes one as a rare case. The need to cope with its impacts is thus even more pressing. This course aims to equip the students with the essential knowledge of ageing studies from the disciplines of literary and cultural studies. We will guide students through the new terrain of literary and cultural gerontology by a perusal of several critical scholarly works. Apart from studying the still-evolving, ever-changing critical discourses of literary and cultural gerontology, we will also incorporate a few literary and cinematic texts into our exploration of the subject. It is hoped that through excavating several significant works of contemporary ageing studies from the perspectives of literary and cultural studies, this course can prepare the students for the coming of a super-aged society, which demands not only a wise, perceptive mind but also an emphatic, benevolent heart.\n\n\\*This course will include a few sinophone films and reading materials in our investigation of ageing issues. Therefore, even though the course is taught in English, students who take this course are required to have good reading, speaking, and listening proficiency in Mandarin Chinese.\n\n**Textbooks & course organization:** \n\nA tentative syllabus based on the reference listed below will be provided in the first class meeting and may be slightly revised after discussion.\n\nDate\n\nWeek\n\nAssignments\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\n_The Oxford Book of Aging: Reflections on the Journey of Life_\n\n3\n\n《微霞與桑榆：陳亮恭醫師的世紀思索》\n\n_Cato Maior de Senectute_\n\n4\n\nInvited Speaker (TBA)\n\n5\n\n_Cato Maior de Senectute_\n\n6\n\n_Disciplining Old Age: The Formation of Gerontological Knowledge_.\n\n7\n\n_Disciplining Old Age: The Formation of Gerontological Knowledge_.\n\n8\n\n_Foucault and Ageing_.\n\n9\n\n_Foucault and Ageing_.\n\n10\n\n_The History of Sexuality_.
