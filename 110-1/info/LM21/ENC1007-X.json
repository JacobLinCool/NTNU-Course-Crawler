    "syllabus": "Seminar in Victorian Literature: Victorian Horror\n\nNational Taiwan Normal University, Fall 2021\n\nWednesdays, 9:20-12:10\n\nDr. Justin Prystash                                                 \n\nOffice: Cheng 720                     \n\nOffice Hours: W 15:20-17:10; F 11:20-13:10; Virtual Meetings by Appointment\n\nEmail: jsprystash@gmail.com               \n\n**Course Description**\n\nThis class will highlight one important strand of Victorian literature: the horror genre, which emerged in its modern form in concert with Gothic literature across the long nineteenth century. We will focus our attention, however, on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I am particularly interested in exploring the type of horror sometimes called “metaphysical” or “cosmic” horror, and we will read a wide range of fiction—especially short stories, but also some novellas—associated with this subgenre. We will also become familiar with various theoretical and critical approaches to horror, and we will watch two films that further investigate the themes of the class. \n\n**Texts**\n\nMany of our readings are short stories, and I will provide PDFs of them. You will need to procure your own editions of the two novellas we will read: William Hope Hodgson’s _The House on the Borderland_ and H. P. Lovecraft’s _At the Mountains of Madness_. I’ve ordered them at Bookman, which is across the street from NTU. \n\n**Assignments**\n\nAttendance/Participation   20%\n\nSeminar Paper (10+ pages) 80% \n\n**Attendance/Participation**\n\nThis is a graduate seminar. Seminars are not meant to be lecture-based, but discussion-based. That means you need to participate in order for us to have a successful seminar (it also means that I need to regularly fade away from the center of the class). Although I will guide our discussions, I expect you to come to class familiar with that week’s assigned reading(s), ready to ask questions and have fruitful discussions and debates. I will take attendance every week. I will also regularly hold in-class group “games” where you will analyze and/or synthesize passages from our texts and share your perspectives with the class. \n\n                 \n**Seminar Paper**\n\nThis is the usual assignment given at the end of a graduate seminar: an academic essay, similar in style and organization to published essays that appear in academic journals. They must focus on one of the texts we read this semester, they cannot be used in any other seminar, and they cannot be plagiarized.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nWeek 1, 9/22: Introduction; Syllabus Review\n\nWeek 2, 9/29: Historical Overview: Jerrold E.
