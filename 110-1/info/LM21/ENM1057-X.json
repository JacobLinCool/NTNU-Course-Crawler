Students will read primary and secondary texts in consultation with their instructors.\n\n**Course Description and Objectives:**\n\nThis two-semester seminar is designed to help MA students become better academic writers. We will develop several different skills that are necessary for academic writing at the MA level: (1) interpreting literature, or “primary sources,” through close reading; (2) interpreting academic scholarship or “secondary sources”; (3) conducting research and documenting sources; and (4) bringing together interpretations of primary and secondary sources into a well-organized academic essay. This course takes a team-based approach, with students working together with professors and peers to improve their writing through several different writing-based activities and workshops. In the first semester, students will complete several short writing assignments with the ultimate goal of writing a very short academic paper; in the second semester, students will work toward writing (or substantially revising) a complete academic essay and sharing their work in a conference presentation.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1.  Grading policy for the fall semester:\n\nAttendance & participation 20%; Writing assignments 80%.\n\nTwo assignments of 850 words and the final assignment of 1800 words, a mini academic paper. The deadlines for the assignments will be posted on Moodle in week 2.   \n\n1.  Punctuality in turning in your homework is required. 5 points per day will be deducted for late submissions. Exceptions are allowed only under emergency circumstances or with notification in advance.\n2.  Any student who plagiarizes will fail the course. This includes self-plagiarism: you can _revise_ an essay/assignment that you have written for another course, but you cannot pass it off as a _new_ essay/assignment.\n\n\\* This is a one-year seminar for literature-track students in the English department; thus, **_the fall semester is a prerequisite._**\n\n**Fall Semester Schedule**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWeek 2-week 10\n\nAaron\n\n**Introduction to Academic Essay Structure**\n\n*   What are some key components of an academic essay in humanities/literary studies?\n*   Focus on coherence, transitions, tone, and register\n*   Writing a commentary on a short primary text\n*   How to identify/locate central arguments of an academic essay?\n\n(e.g. abstract, introduction, conclusion)\n\n*   How to respond to and/or evaluate an academic essay?\n*   Structure of an academic paper\n*   MLA citations style\n\nWeek 11-18\n\nIoana\n\n**Finding Your “Niche,” Finding Your “Voice”: Doing a Literature Review and Engaging in Close Reading**\n\n*   How to join a scholarly conversation on a topic?
