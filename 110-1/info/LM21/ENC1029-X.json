There was a “theory explosion” at the time performance studies was emerging as a major field of studies. As of today, critical theory has changed and transformed the field by enlarging the very conceptions of performance, returning performance history and criticism to philosophy, and overhauling the traditional delineations between texts and performances. These changes have had long-term consequences for how we think and write and perform. In addition, much of the critical theory of the past decades has been absorbed into scholarship in such a way that it is taken for granted in its conceptual vocabulary and in the context of performances. Critical theory has provided fresh starting points each time someone begins a research project or rethinks familiar terrain. This course is intended to provide a guided close reading of some major texts with regard to performance studies. In the course of this class, students will become familiar with a broad range of conceptual perspectives and scholarly applications of performance studies through reading, writing, and class presentations (performances).\n\nMost important of all, the main goal of the course is not only to introduce the core theories and practices which in some way characterize the field of performance studies but also to stimulate students’ interests to further study related fields and help those who have already involved in performance studies to advance their knowledge about ritual theatre, theatre anthropology, and global and intercultural performance.\n\n**Required Texts**\n==================\n\nSchechner, Richard. _Performance Studies: An Introduction_. 3rd ed.

An 8-10 page double-spaced term paper, edited and polished, will be due on Jan.\n\n7, 2022. \n\n1.  The term paper should be a thoughtful critical discussion of a topic or an issue related to the course.\n2.
