    "description": "There has been a proliferation of new products and strategies in the asset\nmanagement space in recent years. This course applies portfolio theory to\nunderstand and evaluate these products and strategies in the context of the empirical\nevidence about return patterns across assets in multiple markets/asset classes. The\nbasic theoretical framework is standard portfolio theory, as developed in\nFoundations of Finance, and its extensions. The course covers the institutional\nlandscape of the asset management business-the firms (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard), the\nvehicles (e.g., mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds), and the trends (e.g., active vs.\npassive, fee competition).",
