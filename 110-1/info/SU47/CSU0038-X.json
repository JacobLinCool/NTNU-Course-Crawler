    "syllabus": "This course, designed for 16+1 weeks, is mainly focused on physical properties of broadcast media, link layer issues in a LAN network architecture particularly on media access control (MAC), and some topics on architectural issues of network managements. Some classic stochastic modelling techniques for MAC performance analysis will also be covered.  \n \n\n1\\. Introduction and technical background\n\n*   Bandwidth~data rate; Nyquist Rate for channel without noise,  Shannon  \n    capacity for channel with noise.\n*   Digit al modulation and multiplexing (TDM, FDM, CDMA, OFDMA)\n*   Framing, error control, and flow control\n\n2\\. LAN/MAN architecture and network management,  IEEE 802  \n3\\. Classic stochastic models for performance analysis  \n4\\. Ethernet LANs, IEEE 802.3  \n5\\. Wireless LANs IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)  \n6\\. Internetworking  \n7\\. Recent topics on dynamic rate selections\n\nIn general, there is no lecture break between a two's class, effectively distributing one week of lecture in a semester of 16 weeks.",
