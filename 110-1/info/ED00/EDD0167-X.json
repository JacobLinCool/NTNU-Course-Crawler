    "syllabus": "**Course Description**\n\nThe aim of this course is to develop graduate students’ abilities to express their ideas in well thought out and well-organized essays in English. It is intended that students can improve their skills for a range of academic writing tasks, e.g., research papers, conference proposals, technical reports, dissertations, or journal articles. Class discussion focuses on the academic writing principles, strategies, and the central role of rhetorical positioning in the development of a clear, interesting and rigorous educational research paper/or proposal. To provide step-by-step hand-on practices, this course incorporates multiple writing assignments with opportunities for text composition, text analysis, peer editing, group editing, and redrafting work, as well as individual conferencing. All the writing activities are based on a diverse collection of topics related to students’ writing needs for their own field-specific work. Main topics include writing process and strategy, elements of writing, writing vocabulary and language, structure of scientific paper. Particular attention is given to the construction of structure, logical arguments, the reporting and interpretation of data, as well as the related important concepts of genre, precision, tone, word choice, flow, and so forth. Students are expected to tailor the opportunities provided by the course to their own academic situation.\n\n**Course Objectives**\n\nAfter taking this course, it is expected that students will be able to:\n\n1.  Incorporate academic structures and language into writing.\n2.  Demonstrate understanding of English academic writing techniques.\n3.  Evaluate sources and apply literature review strategies to construct logical arguments.\n4.  Communicate findings of scholarly research through multiple genres of writing.   \n5.  Expand understanding of specified field of study through writing.\n6.  Enhance academic writing skills to increase the quality of research paper for publishing.\n\n**Course requirements**\n\nThis is a 3-credit-hour course combined with lectures, discussions, and various in class learning activities, homework assignments, and individual conferencing. To have fruitful learning and productive writing outcomes, students are expected to adhere to the following:\n\n**Attendance and Participation:** (1) to be in class on time and come to class ready to participate; (2) to share ideas and works bravely for feedback and editing; (3) to contribute to peer feedback and group discussions.\n\n**Completion of Assignments:** (1) to complete reading assignments before coming to the class; (2) to complete class exercises collaboratively in time for class discussion; and (3) to complete individual homework assignments independently by the due date, including various samples of academic writings, such as definitions, commentaries, paraphrases, summaries, critiques, an abstract, and a research paper.\n\n**Individual Conferencing:** (1) to turn in the paper for discussion at least 2 days before the individual meeting; (2) to make sure the paper being turned in can present the _best_ being done for the work (remember that the writing coach/instructor is not a proof reader or paper editor).   \n\n**Academic Integrity:** (1) to complete and hand in personal own original work; (2) to avoid plagiarism by following the standards of academic integrity and honesty in all scholastic work.\n\n**Schedule**\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Topic**\n\n**Reading**\n\n**Exercise/Assignment**\n\n9/28\n\n**Course Introduction**\n\n**What is intended to accomplish?**\n\n\\- the course objectives\n\n\\- personal learning/writing goals\n\nPersonal Intro/ Biostatement\n\n10/5\n\n**Overview of the Writing Process and Strategies**\n\n\\-audience, purpose, planning, organizing, style, flow, presentation\n\nBooth, et.al, 1-28\n\nBailey, 1-10\n\n(S&F, 1-54)\n\nSharing personal intended writing topic/s\n\nPeer feedback\n\n10/12\n\n**Planning the Writing**\n\n\\-topic/title, concepts, structure\n\n**Reading—Literature Review**\n\n**Finding Suitable Sources**\n\n**\\-**from topics to questions, to problems, to sources\n\nBailey, 11-18\n\nBooth, et.al, 29-84\n\n10/19\n\n**Literature Review—Developing Critical Approaches**\n\n\\-reading strategies\n\n\\-fact, opinion, evidence, argument\n\n\\-assessing sources critically\n\nBailey, 19-29;
