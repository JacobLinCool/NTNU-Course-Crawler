    "description": "In this course, we will cover major applications of statistical data analysis in the field of biological sciences. We will emphasize on the experimental/sampling designs that are appropriate for each data analysis approach. Students are expected to actively participate in group discussion and lab exercises (using R), and each student will present an independent final project demonstrating her/his ability to apply appropriate statistical analyses to a real-world data set, given the scientific questions being posted and the experimental design used to collect the data.",
