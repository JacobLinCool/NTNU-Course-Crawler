    "syllabus": "**The Objectives:**\n\nThis course is designed to support college freshmen in their use of **English language in an academic context** through **intensive and extensive reading** and **skill/strategy training**. In addition, it also aims to build student proficiency in the output language skills—**writing and speaking**—through a variety of activities that integrate all four language skills.\n\nOverall, the objectives of this class will focus on (1) **developing** **effective English reading skills**, (2) **improving fluency in critically expressing ideas** in both oral and written forms in English, and (3) **introducing autonomous self-study skills** for future learning. Therefore, there will be a five-pronged approach to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** the **course textbook** and **online practice website** consist of a purposefully structured skills and strategies program to **propel language learning** and **create independent learners**. Furthermore, the textbook helps improve **vocabulary learning, reading proficiency** and **develop practical critical thinking.**\n\n**2) Secondly,** over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a **performance task-based project**, in which task groups, of no more than 4 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics that are of interest to them**, and then **present their work to the class** via film, audio, or live performance. This can include a short film, online video, radio show, podcast, play or a live play/skit or performance (e.g. music, magic, comedy).\n\n**3) Thirdly,** students are expected to read extensively to improve their English reading, especially online and library **Lexile books.** There will be a **Lexile Test** in both semesters to assess each student’s improvement in reading.\n\n**3) Fourthly,** students will need to do at least **_10 hours_ of** **autonomous learning** in total this semester. These experiences must be **proven or recorded** and handed in at the end of the semester**.**\n\n**4) Finally**, in the second half of the course, there will be a **writing workshop** for which students will be asked to write **a short critical essay** based on class work.\n\n**N.B: All course elements will be evaluated and assessed for final grading.**\n\n**COURSE SCHEDULE** (Note: This may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion.)\n\n**Wk**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Content**\n\n**Notes**\n\n**1**\n\n**9/27**\n\n      Introduction & Orientation\n--------------------------------\n\n**Online class**\n\n**HW: book review**\n\n**2**\n\n**10/4**\n\n1.
