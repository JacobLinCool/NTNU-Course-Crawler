    "syllabus": "**Course Objectives**\n\nThe course is designed to help students develop their English skills. The aim of this course is thus multifold: to enhance students’ English reading comprehension, to increase their vocabulary by looking at how a given word is used in multiple contexts, and to improve their critical thinking skills through thought-provoking texts. Thus, the assigned readings cover a wide variety of topics in literature and culture: K-pop music, cancel culture, Harry Potter, detective fiction, etc.. In this semester, students are expected to attend classes regularly, to hand in homework punctually, and to participate actively in class discussion. Any copy-and-paste content is prohibited in homework and group presentation.\n\n**Course Requirements and Grading**\n\n1.  Attendance and class participation (25%)  \n    In this semester, students have to attend classes regularly and to prepare for class discussion guided through the assigned texts. The course simultaneously encourages them to respond critically to questions raised by the texts. The attendance policy allows students to take a personal leave **TWICE** without penalty only in a situation where they send a formal absence e-mail to the instructor. HOWEVER, absence from **THREE** classes will affect their grade on this part (raw score\\* 0.8). **Students absent from FOUR classes will fail the course. Please note that late arrival (arriving 20 minutes late to class) counts as absence.**  \n     \n2.  Vocabulary quizzes and listening practices (25%)  \n    Details will be further announced and discussed in the first meeting.  \n     \n3.  Midterm group or individual presentation (25%)  \n    Details will be further announced and discussed in the first meeting.  \n     \n4.  (Final) Oral exam (25%)  \n    The oral exam is tentatively scheduled for 7 Jan 2022. Topics selected for the exam will be announced a week prior to the exam date. In a five-minute conversation with the instructor, each student is expected to express well-informed opinions on the topic randomly assigned to them.  \n\n**Class Schedule（Tentative）**\n\n暫定教學進度：本學期實施【16+2週】上課進度。(實際上課內容將視情況調整。)",
