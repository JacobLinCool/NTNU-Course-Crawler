    "syllabus": "                                                                                                                      **English Discussion Course** \n\n                                                                                                                             **Fall Semester, 2020** \n\n**Course Objectives:**\n\nThis course aims to enhance students’ English language proficiency, communication competence and interpersonal skills in order to work effectively and constructively in small group discussions. More specifically, the course will provide students with extensive language practices and many speaking interactions that will help them to express their opinions and build effective oral communication skills. In particular, through the case studies of controversial issues presented in class, students will engage in discussions that require their critical analysis and active participations. In sum, from the course, students will (1). learn to work productively in team discussions (2).gain practical experiences in leading and participating in small group discussions and (3).develop their speaking competency in English.  \n  \nGrading Basis and Course Requirements:  \n  \n(1). Attendance and discussion preparation - (15%): Students are expected to attend the class well prepared for the assigned discussion units in Discussion Starter. Please note that if you have more than two unexcused absences, your grade might be in danger. In addition, tardiness and absences will affect your final grade. (If you want an excused absence, you should try to inform the instructor beforehand and submit a “note of absence” to the instructor afterwards.)  \n  \n(2). Discussion leading - (20%): Each individual student will be required to lead four discussions in total during this semester. These discussions will be theme-based and we will spend 2 weeks on each subject. Students are responsible for the reading materials and discussion questions, and prepare enough printouts for their group members (make sure to cite your references). The materials for each discussion leading should be submitted to the instructor one week before the designated date.  \n  \n(3). Weekly journal entries (20%): Students are required to write a short journal entry each week (between 1/2 page to 1 page double-spaced). In your journals, you could include the observations that you have made or new things that you have learned during our in-class group discussions.  \n  \n(4). Reflection essay (5%): You have to submit a 3-page (double spaced) reflection paper. The paper should reflect your overall learning experience in this class.  \n  \n(5). Participation (10%): This course requires students to make effective and active participations in group discussions. Therefore, students' contributions in these discussions will be evaluated by their peers.  \n  \n(6).
