Students will have a chance to familiarize themselves with the style of journalistic writing, build their vocabulary, sharpen their reading comprehension, and keep current with world news. As the class is conducted entirely in English, students will also get a chance to improve their spoken English.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**_Course Material._**\n\n  \n\nl _English by Newspaper_, by Terry L. Fredrickson and Paul F. Wedel, published by Thomson, 1984. (Available at文鶴書局, 金山南路2段200號3樓. Mention course title and ask for discounts.)\n\n  \n\nl Assigned news articles. Most of these will be handed out in class. Occasionally you may have to download an article from our e-learning platform Moodle: <http://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/>. Be sure to keep an active email account there.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**_Useful Websites._**\n\n  \n\nl AP (The Associated Press) <http://www.ap.org/>\n\n  \n\nl BBC News (British Broadcasting Corporation) <http://news.bbc.co.uk/>\n\n  \n\nl CNN.com (Cable News Network) <http://www.cnn.com/>\n\n  \n\nl The Economist <http://www.economist.com/index.html>\n\n  \n\nl Guardian Unlimited <http://www.guardian.co.uk/>\n\n  \n\nl International Herald Tribune <http://www.iht.com/>\n\n  \n\nl New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/>\n\n  \n\nl Newsweek <http://www.newsweek.com>\n\n  \n\nl The Onion <http://www.theonion.com/>\n\n  \n\nl Reuters <http://today.reuters.com/news/home.aspx>\n\n  \n\nl Time Magazine <http://www.time.com/time/>\n\n  \n\nl UPI (United Press International) <http://www.upi.com>\n\n  \n\nl Washington Post <http://www.washingtonpost.com/>\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**_How to Study for This Course._**\n\n  \n\nl Be sure to finish all the assigned reading prior to class meeting.\n\n  \n\nl Study vocabulary actively. This is essential to the advancement of your English proficiency. Make use of the glossary (definition of vocabulary) at the back of the textbook.\n\n  \n\nl After reading a news story, you should learn to summarize it in your own words (this is a skill called “paraphrase”).\n\n  \n\nl Class activities may include the following: \\--paraphrasing a news story\n\n  \n\n\\--going over difficult words and sentences\n\n  \n\n\\--drilling sentence patterns\n\n  \n\n\\--discussing the news story\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**_Requirements._**\n\n  \n\nl Conscientious preparation, regular attendance, and active class participation.\n\n  \n\nl Choice between an oral presentation and a reading response. Those who choose to give a presentation should sign up at the beginning of the semester (see class schedule below for weekly topics). Make a ten-minute presentation on the “spotlight news media of the week.” Avoid meandering on the website of the news agency through those “menus.” Alternatively, you may choose to write a 400-word reading response to any assigned news article we read this term. Turn it in any day before the final exam.\n\n  \n\nl Three exams (focus: vocabulary, sentence patterns, and reading comprehension).\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n**_Grading._**\n\n  \n\nattendance and class participation 30%\n\n  \n\npresentation or reading response 10%\n\n  \n\nexams 60%\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**\\*\\*\\*****CHEATING ON EXAMS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Class Schedule**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n**wk**\n\n  \n\n**date**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**required readin****g**\n\n  \n\n**topic for**\n\n  \n\n**“spotlight news media of the week”**\n\n  \n\n**1**\n\n  \n\n**9/14**\n\n  \n\nIntroduction to Course\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**2**\n\n  \n\n**9/21**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 5, “Understanding Headlines,” pp. 58-64\n\n  \n\nl Headline Vocabulary, pp. 64-67 (memorize the vocab!)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**3**\n\n  \n\n**9/28**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 2, “The Newspaper Lead,” pp. 12-20\n\n  \n\nl BBC\n\n  \n\n**4**\n\n  \n\n**10/5**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 2, “The Newspaper Lead,” pp. 21-28\n\n  \n\nl _New York Times_\n\n  \n\n**5**\n\n  \n\n**10/12**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 3, “Beyond the Lead,” pp. 33-39\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl _Washington_ _Post_\n\n  \n\n**6**\n\n  \n\n**10/19**\n\n  \n\n**EXAM #1**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**7**\n\n  \n\n**10/26**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 3, “Beyond the Lead,” pp. 39-45\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl Reuters, AP, and UPI (focus on the first two)\n\n  \n\n**8**\n\n  \n\n**11/2**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 4, “Understanding Words in Context,” pp. 47-51\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl _The International Herald Tribune_\n\n  \n\n**9**\n\n  \n\n**11/9**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 4, “Understanding Words in Context,” pp. 52-57\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl _Time_ and _Newsweek_\n\n  \n\n**1****0**\n\n  \n\n**11/16**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 7, “Other Kinds of Newspaper Writing,” pp. 89-91 (“The Column” & “The Editorial”)\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl _Guardian Unlimited_\n\n  \n\n**1****1**\n\n  \n\n**11/23**\n\n  \n\n**EXAM #2**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**1****2**\n\n  \n\n**11/30**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 7, “Other Kinds of Newspaper Writing,” pp. 79, 86-87 (“The Feature Story”)\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl _The Onion_\n\n  \n\n**1****3**\n\n  \n\n**12/7**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 10, “Crime and the Courts,” pp. 108, 112-113\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl Famous blogs or private sites that feature news stories\n\n  \n\n**1****4**\n\n  \n\n**12/14**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 12, “Strikes . . . ,” p. 122\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl Famous tabloids\n\n  \n\n**15**\n\n  \n\n**12/21**\n\n  \n\nl Ch. 14, “Energy,” p. 134\n\n  \n\nl assigned news article(s)\n\n  \n\nl English-language newspapers in Taiwan\n\n  \n\n**1****6**\n\n  \n\n**12/28**\n\n  \n\n**_Quiz Contest:_**\n\n  \n\n**_Who is Miss/Mr. World News?_**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**1****7**\n\n  \n\n**1/4**\n\n  \n\n**EXAM #3**",
