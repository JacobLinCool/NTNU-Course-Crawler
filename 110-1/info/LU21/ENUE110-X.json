Each student is required to write a lesson plan and then teach for 30 minutes, with all his/her classmates as students and observers. The micro-teaching is followed by a discussion session led by the instructor, with an aim to help improve students’ teaching techniques. \nThe second semester covers the following as the primary activities: talks by experienced senior teachers on various topics, more classroom observations, and a 6-week practice teaching at the Affiliated High School of NTNU. In addition to work related to the micro-teaching and practice teaching, students are required to write various reports and participate in classroom discussion and evaluation.",

After the micro-teaching session, the instructor will lead a discussion session to help the teaching group improve their professional knowledge and skills.\n\n1.  **Lesson Plan**\n\n1.  Students will work in a small group to write a lesson plan that covers **four class periods** for the first micro-teaching (junior high school English class) and **five class periods** for the second micro-teaching (senior high school English class). The lesson plan must be typewritten and formatted according to the sample lesson plans provided in this class.\n2.  Before each micro-teaching session, the teaching group must turn in their lesson plan **(1st version)** to the instructor **at least two weeks before** their teaching demonstration. After the instructor reads the lesson plan, he will discuss it with the teaching group **one week before** the micro-teaching session.\n3.  After discussing with the instructor, the teaching group needs to revise their lesson plan and submit a revision **(2nd version)** to the instructor **on the day of micro-teaching, before they start to teach**.\n4.  Each group must hand in **a** **final version** of their lesson plans on Moodle at the end of the semester, and all lesson plans have to be carefully proofread and well formatted.\n\n1.  **Micro-teaching**\n\n1.  The teaching group needs to prepare teaching materials (e.g., class handouts) and distribute them to their classmates for their micro-teaching.\n2.  In general, each student will have approximately 25 to 30 minutes to teach for each micro-teaching session.\n3.  The teaching group will be assisted by a video-taping group (i.e., the **next** teaching group) on the day of micro-teaching. The video-taping group needs to borrow a camcorder from the English Department and set it up before the micro-teaching starts (Please contact the department office to reserve a camcorder in advance). On the day of micro-teaching, they need to time and video-tape the teaching group’s teaching demonstration.\n4.  On the day of micro-teaching, students who are not in the teaching group or the video-taping group will act as students and provide comments and suggestions for the teaching group.\n5.  After the micro-teaching session is completed, the instructor will lead a discussion session to help the teaching group improve their teaching knowledge and skills.\n6.  After each micro-teaching session, every student in the teaching group needs to watch his/her own teaching demonstration, write an individual reflection report (no less than two pages), and submit it to the instructor **within one week** (for Reflections 4 & 6). The reflection report should also incorporate feedback from classmates.",
