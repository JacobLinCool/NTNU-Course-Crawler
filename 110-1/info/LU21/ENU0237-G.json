    "syllabus": "寫作指導（一）**Guided Writing (Fall 2021)**\n\nMonday 15:30-17:20\n\n### Instructor: Hsi-Yao Su 蘇席瑤\n\n### Email: hsysu@ntnu.edu.tw\n\nOffice: Cheng 718\n\nOffice Hours: Mon. 1-3:30p, Wed. 10:30a-12\n\n**Course description:**\n\nThis course (the first one in a two-semester series) is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. Specifically, it aims to (1) familiarize students with the fundamentals of paragraph structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), (2) equip them with organizing skills to maximize the effectiveness of writing from paragraphs to short-essays, and (3) improve language skills for concise expressions of ideas. In the first semester, students are expected to review important topics of English paragraph-writing. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. The course also develops students’ analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, definition, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, and classification.\n\n**Textbook:**\n\nLangan, J. (2011). _Essay skills_ (2nd ed.). Chicago, Il: McGraw-Hill.

The expected length of each writing assignment is around 200-300 words. The assignments should be turned in on the class Moodle site.\n\n2\\.
