It will focus on research methods used in language-related studies, but is not restricted to them. \n\nMoreover, the research methods introduced in this course will be applicable not only in academic studies but also in workplace when research is needed for further development and improvement. \n\nMore importantly, this course helps students to think clearly when developing their own research topics and to evaluate the arguments made as well as the methods employed by their peers.",

As we introduce the basics of research methods, these methods should be applicable in academic studies as well as in students' future workplace when research is needed for further development and improvement. The finished product of this course is a research proposal of your own with some initial result from a pilot study.\n\n**Main Textbooks**\n\n1\\. Walliman, Nicholas. (2011).
