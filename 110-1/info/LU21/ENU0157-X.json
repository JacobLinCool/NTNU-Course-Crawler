    "description": "This course aims to give students a critical introduction to postcolonial literature by focusing on Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will focus on the topic of “Decolonizing Malaya” to explore the post-WWII independence movement in Malaysia and Singapore. In the context of Southeast Asia, it is important to know that most countries in Southeast Asia became independent after World War II. We will focus on a selection of poems from various Singaporean and Malaysian poets, as well as chapters from Gungwu Wang’s biography Home Is Where We Are (2018) to examine the processes of decolonization in Malaya. In the second half of the semester, we will focus on Taiwan by reading Two Trees Make a Forest (2020), a family memoir of the migration from China, Taiwan, to Canada. We will examine how that process helps the writer, Jessica J. Lee, come to terms with the complicated colonial histories of Taiwan. By reflecting upon the decolonizing movements in Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, we will investigate the legacies of colonization which still haunt these places. Students will also be required to attend lectures to substitute the sessions for Weeks 17 and 18.*",
    "goals": [
        "Providing a general survey of post-colonial theories and theories of urban studies, as well as the relevance of urban space to the body.",
        "Exploring how the concept of the body is used as a metaphor or motif in the urban representations of some post-colonial cities by reading a few literary works.",
        "Students will be encouraged to submit their final papers to relevant international conferences or apply for the NSC project for undergraduate students."

    "syllabus": "Descriptions: This course aims to give students a critical introduction to postcolonial literature by focusing on Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Divided into two parts, it will explore the process of post-war independence in Southeast Asia. In the first part, we will focus on the topic of “Decolonizing Malaya” to examine post-WWII independence movements in Malaysia and Singapore. We will read a selection of poems from various Singaporean and Malaysian poets, as well as chapters from Gungwu Wang’s memoir _Home Is Where We Are_ (2018). In the second half, we will focus on the Philippines by reading two novels, _Banyaga: A Song of War_ (2006) by Chinese Filipino writer Charlson Ong and _Migrante_ (2020) by expatriate Canadian writer, Joe W. Hanley. By reflecting upon the decolonizing movements in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, we will investigate the legacies of colonization in these countries. Students will be required to attend lectures and events that substitute the sessions for weeks 17 and 18.\\*    \n\nSchedule (subject to change)\n\nWks\n\nDates\n\nReadings and Activities\n\nPresentations\n\n1\n\n09/27\n\nIntroduction           \n\n2\n\n10/04\n\n_Crazy Rich Asians_, 2018 (Film)\n\nChapters 1-2, _Crazy Rich Asians_, 2015\n\nBy Kevin Kwan (關凱文)  \n\n3\n\n**10/11**\n\n**Holiday**\n\n4\n\n10/18\n\nCecile Parrish, “Ships at Singapore” (186-187)\n\nRobert Yeo, “Malacca Grandmother” (198-199)\n\nEdwin Thumboo, “Conformity” (246-247)\n\n\\---, “Ulysses by the Merlion” (253-254)\n\nLee Tzu Pheng, “Bukit Timah, Singapore” (273-275)\n\n\\---, “My Country and My People” (277-278)\n\nKirpal Singh, “They Told Us” (327)\n\n\\---, “Walking Down the Streets” (328)\n\nGopal Baratham, “Welcome” (329-332)\n\nKoh Buck Song, “Close Quarters, Chinatown” (449)\n\n_The Garden of Evening Mist_, 2019 (Film)\n\n_The Garden of Evening Mist_, 2012\n\nBy Tan Twan Eng (陳團英)\n\n5\n\n10/25\n\nShirley Geok-lin Lim, “Mango” (31)\n\n\\---, “Father from Asia” (32)\n\nSalleh Ben Joned, “Malchin Testament” (110-111)\n\nGhulam Sarwar, “May 13, 1969” (237)\n\n\\---, “Honolulu Airport” (254)\n\nOmar Mohd Noor, “Malaysian Sun Misbehaves” (267)\n\nSalleh Ben Joned, “Spirit of the Keris” (286-288)\n\nChapters 1-3, _Home Is Where We Are_\n\n6\n\n11/01\n\nChapters 4-6, _Home Is Where We Are_\n\n7\n\n11/08\n\nChapters 7-9, _Home Is Where We Are_\n\n8\n\n**11/15**\n\n**Midterm Project Presentations**\n\n9\n\n11/22\n\n_Banyaga: A Song of War_\n\n10\n\n11/29\n\n_Banyaga: A Song of War_\n\n11\n\n12/06\n\n_Banyaga: A Song of War_\n\n12\n\n12/13\n\n_Banyaga: A Song of War_\n\n13\n\n12/20\n\n_Migrante_\n\n14\n\n12/27\n\n_Migrante_\n\n15\n\n01/03\n\n_Migrante_\n\n16\n\n01/10\n\n_Migrante_\n\nGrading Policy and Requirements\n\n1.
