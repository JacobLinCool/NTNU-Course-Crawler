Specifically, it aims to (1) familiarize students with the fundamentals of paragraph structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), (2) equip them with organizing skills to maximize the effectiveness of writing from paragraphs to short-essays, and (3) improve language skills for concise expressions of ideas. In the first semester, students are expected to review important topics of English paragraph-writing. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. The course also develops students’ analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, definition, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, and classification.\n\n**Textbook:**\n\nLangan, J. (2011). _Essay skills_ (2nd ed.). Chicago, Il: McGraw-Hill. Cost of the book is $425.\n\n**Grading:**\n\nIn-class Participation and discussion\n\n20%\n\nAssignments\n\n80%\n\n**Class Policies:**\n\n1\\. In this semester, students are expected to complete three writing assignments on three different modes—description, narration and process. Each assignment includes a draft and a revision. The expected length of each writing assignment is one paragraph of around 200-300 words.\n\n2\\. Students are expected to attend each class—attendance will be taken. Multiple absences may result in an automatic failing grade.\n\n3\\. Students who miss class are responsible for content. Any student who misses a class has the responsibility for obtaining copies of notes, handouts, assignments, etc.\n\n4\\. All typed assignments completed outside of class must be 1.5-spaced with 12 font size.\n\n5\\. Written assignments must be handed in on time.\n\n6\\.
