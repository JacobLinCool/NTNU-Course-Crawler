    "description": "This two-semester second-level writing course aims to guide students to (1) practice basic academic writing convention, (2) sharpen analytical essay writing skills, (3) enhance essay coherence and cohesion, and (4) develop a clear writing style. The course will familiarize students with proper academic language and convention to compose five-paragraph short essays on the following five modes of writing: argumentation, definition, causal analysis, process analysis, and comparison and contrast. In addition to the different analytical modes of writing, the course will introduce students to organizing and editing strategies to fine-tune their essay writing. On the one hand, students will learn how to apply principles of coherence and cohesion in their writing to maintain consistent claims and to offer logical transitions at the levels of ideas, sentences, and paragraphs. On the other hand, students will learn how to develop a clear writing style by avoiding common sentence errors and improving concision and specificity in word choice and sentence formation.",
