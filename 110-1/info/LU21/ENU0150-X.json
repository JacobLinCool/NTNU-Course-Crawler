The main objective of this course is to introduce you to theories and methods of teaching English to speakers of other languages. In this course, we will trace the historical development of second language teaching methods from grammar based curricula to present day interactive methods, where most of our focus will be placed. TESOL approaches and methods will be studied in their practical settings and in terms of their theoretical underpinnings. In addition to the theoretical focus, we will also discuss the practical aspects of teaching English as a foreign/second language. By the end of the course, you will be well-versed in applying major teaching methods that are currently being used in most EFL/ESL classrooms. teaching.",
