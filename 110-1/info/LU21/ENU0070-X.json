    "description": "To understand DRAMA, we need to understand THEATER, because the theater forges the active interplay between drama and its community.  --W. B. Worthen   This course sets out to introduce and examine three topics of theatre: 1. feminism and theatre; 2. metadrama and metatheatre; 3. the theatre of the absurd. We will look at a wide gamut of materials and establish methods of inquiry that will enable us to look critically at such complex issues as feminist theatre, metadramatic or metatheatrical form, and the theatre of absurd components and practices. Other than selected dramatic works from modern time, we will also read related critical writings that have a bearing on the topics of dramatic/theatrical styles and movements. We will study all these texts intensely through close reading within class and practice viewing a text through the prism of different critical approaches or frameworks.  This course is suitable for beginning students and should serve as preparation for further study in either dramatic literature and theater arts. Lively discussion, debate, and differences of opinion will be crucial to our seminar meetings.",

B. Worthen\n\n        This course sets out to introduce and examine three topics of theatre: 1. Gender Studies and Theatre; 2. Metadrama and Metatheatre; 3. the Theatre of the Absurd. We will look at a wide gamut of materials and establish methods of inquiry that will enable us to look critically at such complex issues of gender in theatre, metadramatic or metatheatrical form, and the theatre of the absurd. Other than selected dramatic works from modern time, we will also read related critical writings that have a bearing on the topics of dramatic/theatrical styles and movements. We will study all these texts intensely through close reading within class and practice viewing a text through the prism of different critical approaches or frameworks.
