    "description": "Technology forecasting attempts to predict the future characteristics and development trends of technology. The technology forecasting capabilities are essentials for production, marketing and R&D managers’ decision making in technology firms. Thus, this course intends to introduce modern technology forecasting theories and practices to the MOT majored graduate level students. Major emphasis of this course will be placed on theory introductions and forecasting techniques manipulations. Students are expected to learn forecasting techniques through lectures and case studies.",
