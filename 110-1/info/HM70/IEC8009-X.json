    "description": "Decision theory is a body of knowledge and related analytical techniques of different degrees of formality designed to help a decision maker choose among a set of alternatives in light of their possible consequences. Decision theory is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. Thus, a good understanding of decision theory can assist officials, managers, teachers, etc. to make correct decisions so as to achieve the aspired levels of the goals with respect to decision problems. \n\n\nIn this course, fundamental concepts as well as advances in modern decision theories and methods will be introduced for serving as the foundation for students�� future researches. Students will be requested to implement decision method(s) on real world problems for verifying their real understanding of the methods.",
