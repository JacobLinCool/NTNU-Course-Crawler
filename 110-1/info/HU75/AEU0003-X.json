    "syllabus": "【授課方式：16+2週】\n\nThis course provides a modern introduction to logic design and the basic building blocks used in digital systems, in particular digital computers. It starts with a discussion of combinational logic: logic gates, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits, and modern logic devices such as field programmable logic gates. The second part of the course deals with sequential circuits: flip-flops, synthesis of sequential circuits, and case studies, including counters, registers, and random access memories. State machines will then be discussed and illustrated through case studies of more complex systems using programmable logic devices. Different representations including truth table, logic gate, timing diagram, switch representation, and state diagram will be discussed.\n\n第一週: Introduction of digital system and the trend of its development\n\n第二週: Binary Systems and binary numbers\n\n第三週: Binary Systems and binary numbers\n\n第四週: Gate-Level Minimization, boolean reduction\n\n第五週: Gate-Level Minimization, k-map\n\n第六週: Combinational Logic circuit design I\n\n第七週: Combinational Logic circuit desogn II\n\n第八週:期中考試\n\n第九週: Synchronous Sequential Circuit: Latch and Flip Flop (D FF, JK FF, T FF)\n\n第十週: Synchronous Sequential Circuit: State machine, state diagram, state transition table\n\n第十一週: Synchronous Sequential Circuit design: State machine, Mealy machine and Moore machine\n\n第十二週: Synchronous Sequential Circuit design: state machine minimization\n\n第十三週: Registers and counters\n\n第十四週: Memory and Programmable Logic\n\n第十五週: Design at the register transfer level\n\n第十六週:期末考試\n\n第十七週: 彈性課程(專題報告)\n\n第十八週: 彈性課程(專題報告)",
