This course focuses on the key issues associated with product miniaturization and micro-manufacturing. Hence, it provides the graduate engineering students with a background in principles and applications for high-precision micro-manufacturing technologies. The course objective is to establish the concepts in high-precision micromachining systems and materials behavior with the scales of microns and nanometers.\n2.  Examples including the design and construction of the high-precision micromachining system, in-situ micromachining, high-speed micro-cutting, micro-EDM, micro w-EDM, micro electrolytic process, electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID), micro metrology, co-deposition, and removal mechanism for hard-brittle materials are considered.\n3.  The class forms the basis for discussion on high-precision micro-manufacturing topics, as well as more formal podium style lectures. Course students are advised to comprehensively read the literatures about high-precision micro-manufacturing technologies which takes from SCI journal papers such as IJMTM, JMM, JMPT, DRM, MST and TSM, and conference papers coming from Diamond 2010-2020, AMPT2010-2020, ISAAT2010-2020, and Thin Films 2010-2020 etc.\n4.  The topics Desktop and Micro-factory paradigm associated with micro-manufacturing will also be discussed. Hence, this course can make students to:\n    1.  Comprehend the theoretical knowledge and practice skill in high-precision micro-manufacturing\n    2.  Be aware of the design of micro-manufacturing system for in-situ micromachining\n    3.  Learn the fundamental principle and their approaches in the In-Situ, On-Machine, Online, Inline, and In-process\n    4.  Realize various process technologies of micro-manufacturing for microstructures machining\n    5.  Understand the Desktop and Micro-factory paradigms associated with micro-manufacturing\n\nPrerequisite\n\nManufacturing process\n\n**課程簡介**\n\n    精微製造工程包括精微放電/精微線切割放電、精微電解/精微電解研削、精微超音波微去除、精微系統建構等，這些微精工程除了具有高的加工精度外，也具很少的加工應力和很低的熱變形，適合許多如生醫產業精微元件、光電產業精微元件、3-C產業精微元件、精微模具、精微刀具與精微量具等精微製品的設計、研發和製造。課程中，除了各種精微工程學理介紹外，也將說明各種技術所需的電氣迴路與機構設備；修習本課程，可瞭解機電整合實務應用與精微元件的技術開發。授課過程中，亦安排具精微產業之專業資深教授、經理與工程技師蒞校演講，並且安排精微產業企業參訪。\n\n**課程目標**\n\n**對應系所核心能力**\n\n1\n\n認識先進精微製造工程之巨觀與微觀。\n\n1-2 設計與執行機電相關實務，以及分析、解釋、撰寫報告之能力。\n\n1-4 具備團隊合作之精神，以及表達、溝通、創新思考及解決問題之能力。\n\n2-3 創新思考及獨立解決問題之能力。\n\n2-6 國際觀、領導、管理及規劃之能力。\n\n2\n\n熟悉各種精微製造工程學理和機制。\n\n1-1 運用數理及科學知識與技術之能力。\n\n1-3 執行機電工程實務所需之知識與技能。\n\n2-1 從事機電相關研究所需之專業知識與技能。\n\n2-2 策劃及執行專題研究之能力。\n\n3\n\n學會各種精微製造工程的特性應用。\n\n1-2 設計與執行機電相關實務，以及分析、解釋、撰寫報告之能力。\n\n1-3 執行機電工程實務所需之知識與技能。\n\n2-2 策劃及執行專題研究之能力。\n\n2-3 創新思考及獨立解決問題之能力。\n\n4\n\n了解各種精微製造工程的量測檢驗。\n\n1-2 設計與執行機電相關實務，以及分析、解釋、撰寫報告之能力。\n\n1-3 執行機電工程實務所需之知識與技能。\n\n2-2 策劃及執行專題研究之能力。\n\n2-5 與不同領域人員協調整合之能力。\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**Syllabus**\n\nLecturer: Prof. Shun-Tong Chen\n\nCredit: 3, Elective\n\nPrerequisite: Manufacturing Processes\n\nTopics and progress\n\nPPT Ch.\n\n1st\n\n22, Sept.\n\nNew semester start, Introduction\n\n01\n\n2nd\n\n29, Sept.\n\nMicrosystem and Tendency\n\nThe development trends of modern fabrication technology / Development and application of the hybrid desktop machine tool\n\n02-1\n\n02-2\n\n3rd\n\n6, Oct.\n\nMicro-Measuring and -Examination\n\nDevelopment and application of the micro measuring center / Development of automatic cells analysis instrument and research of microscope examination of urinary sediments\n\n03-1\n\n03-2\n\n4th\n\n13, Oct.\n\nGlass and Ductile-like Grinding\n\nA self-regulating feed-rate machine tool for quartz glass / Study of a ductile-like cutting regime technology for glass-ceramic cutting\n\nSpecial Lecture-1\n\n04-1\n\n04-2\n\n5th\n\n20, Oct.\n\nIn-situ and High-Speed Grinding\n\nAn in-situ hybrid microhole fabrication technique on mold steel /\n\nDevelopment of an intellectualized high-speed grinding machine for LED tungsten carbide probe grinding\n\n05-1\n\n05-2\n\n6th\n\n27, Oct.\n\nDevelopment of a microscopic slide mold\n\nDevelopment of an electroforming diamond wheel tool array for making a microscopic slide mold / Development of a microscopic slide mold by a laboratory-designed BD-PCD wheel tool\n\nSpecial Lecture-2\n\n06-1\n\n06-2\n\n7th\n\n3, Nov.\n\nMicro-EDM Power Source\n\nDesign and applications of a plural resistance-capacitance (mRC) power source / A high-density, super-high-aspect-ratio microprobe array realized by high-frequency vibration assisted inverse micro w-EDM\n\n07-1\n\n07-2\n\n8th\n\n10, Nov.\n\nBlanking and Holing on Glass\n\nDevelopment of a hollow grinding tool for fine blanking of lens cover glass / Development of a grinding-drilling technique for holing optical grade glass\n\n09-1\n\n09-2\n\n9th\n\n17, Nov.\n\nDesign of the Micro System Integration Center\n\nSpecial Lecture-3\n\n10\n\n10th\n\n24, Nov.\n\nMidterm exam (Range: 1st-8th)\n\n11th\n\n1, Dec.\n\nMicro-Cutting and -Grinding-1\n\n11\n\n12th\n\n8, Dec.\n\nMicro-Cutting and -Grinding-2\n\n12\n\n13th\n\n15, Dec.\n\nMicro-Electric-Discharge-Machining\n\nDevelopment of a penetrating intra-cortical electrode array using micro electro-machining\n\nSpecial Lecture-4\n\n13-1\n\n13-2\n\n14th\n\n22, Dec.\n\nMicro-Electro Chemical Machining and Polishing\n\n14\n\n15th\n\n29, Dec.\n\nMulti Micro-Electro Machining\n\n15\n\n16th\n\n5, Jan.\n\nFinal exam (Range: 9th-15th)\n\n17th\n\n12, Jan.\n\nSelf-directed learning-1\n\n18th\n\n19, Jan.\n\nSelf-directed learning-2\n\nMethods of teaching\n\n1.
