Material needed for upper-tier students but not taught in standard university classes, e.g. trilinear coordinate, combinatorial arguments, will be also compensated if time is allowed.\n\nWe will introduce various topics via a collection of problems. Students are required to solve, discuss and study the theory involved. No textbooks are required, textbooks used in the first 3 years are useful. \n\nActive presentation and active discussion in class are highly anticipated. \n\nA independent project is required at the end of the semester.\n\nThis course will follow the 16+2 weeks policy.",
