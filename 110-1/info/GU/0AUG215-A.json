    "syllabus": "**\\*\\*\\*\\*Course taught entirely in English\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Aims and methods**\n\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students with an introductory history of western art and its literary reception. Each week we will be looking at a different cluster of visual artworks and discussing it with reference to (1) its own cultural context and (2) a short literary text written in response or as a complement to it.\n\nThe course will, in the main, follow the chronology of the visual artworks that we will be considering. This means we will move from renaissance to modern/contemporary periods of artistic production. The literary texts we will be looking at are mostly poems from the twentieth century. Students on this course will always be encouraged to try out their own interpretations of works of visual art and literary texts alike.\n\nThe themes that bind the course together: ekphrasis, ethical forms of looking, written and visualized forms of desire, polyvalence (i.e. multiple meanings), writing/painting violence, modernity and nostalgia.\n\n**Typical lesson structure**     \n\nStudent presentations (see Grading)\n\nTeacher’s lecture and class discussion of work of art\n\nClose reading and discussion of poem written as response or complement to work of art\n\n**Grading**\n\nPresentation (20%). Each student will do one presentation, **which should last no longer than 4 mins**. The presentation will usually provide background material on the artist/artistic period covered in the session. The presentation must include at least three images.\n\nMidterm and final (40% each). In each exam students will compare and contrast two or more poems from the course. These essays will explain the poems’ dealings with the world of visual art.\n\nPlagiarism will not be tolerated: document every source you make use of in your work.\n\n**Schedule (may be affected by Taiwanese holidays)**\n\n1\\.
