In this seminar, doctoral students will explore the topics that are only leading towards the edge, but also moving, shaking, and redefining the foundation of LIS as an academic discipline, a practice profession, and an education ground. The topics will include, but not limited to the debate of open science, the dilemma of gender equity in information science, and the rise of interdisciplinarity and its impact on scholarly communication. The major activities will consist of reading and class participation, while independent research and study and group interaction will also add up to ensure students a positive transition and a successful learning experience. This course will be in the form of complete online teaching and learning, and will meet online twice a week.\n\n**COURSE PHILOSOPHY**\n\nThe course is highly participatory, and, as such, students will engage in active learning through discussion, reading, guest talks, and term projects. Because of the emphasis on active learning, it is important that students attend each class meeting. If an absence is necessary, please ask a peer to share notes from the session and let the instructor know by e-mail that you will not attend.\n\nMy teaching belief is based upon the social constructivist notion of knowledge and learning, by which a learning community is created as a collaborative effort. Through active participation and interaction, members within this learning community help each other master the key concepts and ideas of the course.\n\n**COURSE SCHEDULE**\n\n#\n\nDate\n\nTopics and
