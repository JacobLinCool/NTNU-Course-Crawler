    "syllabus": "English Pronunciation (II)\n\nFall 2022\n\n**Meeting Time/Place**: Thur., 10:20 - 12:10/ Cheng 304\n\n**Instructor**: Nissa Hui-shan Lin  **Email**: [hslin@ntnu.edu.tw](mailto:hslin@ntnu.edu.tw)**Office**: Cheng 705\n\n**Office hours**: Tue. 8:10~10:10; Thur. 8:10~10:10\n\n**I. Course Description:**\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help students improve their pronunciation of the English language as they speak it. With a brief introduction to the nature of English consonant and vowel production, as well as the peculiar characteristics of the supra-segmental features of the language, the course provides students with various kinds of listening and speaking practice. Special focus of the oral/aural practice will be placed on pairs/groups of potentially confusing sounds, linking of sounds across syllable/word boundaries, stress, intonation, rhythm, etc. In addition to classroom drills, 2 recording assignments and 2 error detection exercises will be given. It is hoped that through the intensive drills students may develop their sound awareness, become conscious of their pronunciation problems and further adopt the most efficient way to solve the problems and improve their pronunciation.\n\n**II.

Course Requirements:**\n\n*   **_Participation and attendance_**:\n\nAlthough class participation and attendance constitute only 25% of your total grade, you should understand that frequent or extended absences would probably impede your learning and the instructor’s evaluation. Some points will be taken for overdue in-class exercises. Absence from a class is no excuse for not knowing the assignment and what has been discussed in that class. **It is your responsibility to ask your classmates or me what has been covered in the class**.\n\n*   **_Midterm and Final Exams:_**\n\nThere will be **no make-up exams** unless you have **valid** and **official** reasons for absence \\***beforehand\\***.\n\n*   **_Recording Assignments_**\n\nThere are 2 big recording assignments and should be uploaded to moodle with the wav, or mp3/4 format. For each day your assignment is late, 5 points will be deducted from your grade for that assignment.\n\n*   **_Error Detection Exercises_**\n\nFind out problems in students’ pronunciation.",
