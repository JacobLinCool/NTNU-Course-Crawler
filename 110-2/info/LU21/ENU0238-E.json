    "syllabus": "Course descriptions:\n\nThis two-semester course is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. Specifically, it aims to (1) familiarize students with the fundamentals of paragraph structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), (2) equip them with organizing skills to maximize the effectiveness of writing from paragraphs to short-essays, and (3) improve language skills for concise expressions of ideas. In the first semester, students are expected to review important topics of English paragraph-writing. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. The course also develops students’ analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, definition, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, and classification. \n\n**Class Policies:**\n\n1. In this semester, students are expected to complete **four** writing assignments on **four** different modes—definition, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, and classification. Each assignment includes a draft and a revision. \n\n2\\. The expected length of each writing assignment is a **three-paragraph essay** of around **500-600** words.\n\n2\\. Students are expected to attend each class—attendance will be taken. Multiple absences may result in an automatic failing grade.\n\n3\\. Students who miss class are responsible for content. Any student who misses a class has the responsibility for obtaining copies of notes, handouts, assignments, etc. \n\n4\\. All typed assignments completed outside of class must be 1.5-spaced with 12 font size.\n\n5\\. Written assignments must be handed in on time. \n\n6\\. All cell phones MUST be turned off during class time.  \n\n7\\. Academic honesty is expected at all times. Plagiarism will result in a serious grade penalty and may lead to an automatic failing grade.\n\n                                                                                                   Class schedule\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Content**\n\n**Notes**\n\n1\n\n2/18\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\n2/25\n\nCh7 Introduction to Essay Development\n\n 1st draft due: What is education?\n\n3\n\n3/4\n\nCh8 Writing the Essay\n\n4\n\n3/11\n\nCh9 Introductions, Conclusions, and Titles\n\n 2nd draft due\n\n5\n\n3/18\n\nCh9 Introductions, Conclusions, and Titles\n\n 1st draft due: The influence of the Internet on children?\n\n6\n\n3/25\n\nCh10 Patterns of Essay Development\n\n7\n\n4/1\n\nCh10 Patterns of Essay Development\n\n8\n\n4/8\n\n**Midterm Exam**\n\n 2nd draft due\n\n9\n\n4/15\n\nCh10 + Ch 6: Definition\n\n10\n\n4/22\n\nCh10 + Ch 6: Cause and Effect\n\n 1st draft due: How does high school differ from college?\n\n11\n\n4/29\n\nCh10 + Ch 6: Cause and Effect\n\n12\n\n5/6\n\nCh10 + Ch 6: Comparison and Contrast\n\n 2nd draft due\n\n13\n\n5/13\n\nCh10 + Ch 6: Comparison and Contrast\n\n 1st draft due: What new social trends appeared after COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n14\n\n5/20\n\nCh10 + Ch 6: Classification\n\n15\n\n5/27\n\n**Final Exam**\n\n 2nd draft due\n\n16\n\n6/3\n\n**National Holiday**\n\n17\n\n6/10\n\n**Digital learning**\n\n18\n\n6/17\n\n**Digital learning**",
