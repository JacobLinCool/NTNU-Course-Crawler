    "syllabus": "_Course Description_\n\nThis course is designed to help students build skills in discussion and leading discussion sessions in the English language. The course will revolve around a variety of topical issues or trends emerging in the glocal community. Students will learn 1) to uncover political, sociological, economic, technological, or cultural trends or issues for class discussion, especially those which have a solid basis in their own interests or specialties; 2) to do quality research on the topics, and to trim and organize research materials in ways that make the topics presentable, understandable and intriguing; 3) to formulate the questions at issue, lead or facilitate a discussion session, and give directions or guidance in a small peer-group; 4) to give _considered_ responses, to express thoughts and opinions based upon their own observation and study. The course aims to create students’ awareness of the world and its cultures, expand the horizon of their knowledge and in a way prepare them for the job market, advanced studies or simply a better life.\n\n_Texts_\n\nThe follows shall provide a reservoir of materials that give students inspiration in considering topics they want to engage with:\n\na.         _Asian Wall Street Journal_, _Newsweek_, _Time_\n\ncurrent or back issues dated within the last 24 months\n\nb.          [www.variety.com](http://www.variety.com)\n\nc.           any journal suggested by students\n\n2.          Miscellaneous materials handed out by discussion leaders or the instructor.\n\n_Format_\n\nThe class will be divided into 4 groups. Each session usually involves two groups. Group A will start a new topic by a) introducing key concepts and basic vocabulary related to the topic, b) handing out preliminary research materials (no more than 12 pages in total) and call attention to passages which the group believes as essential to the understanding of the topic c) giving questions to be dealt with in the following session. In the following week, Group A will lead the discussion with the expectation that the whole class has familiarized themselves with the vocabulary, digested the materials, and thought about the questions and come up with answers or more questions of their own. When a topic is wrapped up by group A in one session, in the following week, group B will give a 10 to 15-min. presentation: 1) summarizing and recapitulating the discussed points in an organized and economic way 2) and giving critique, compliment, or suggestions to ways group A could have improved in presenting/organizing materials or leading discussion. After this short presentation, group B will _at the same time_ submit a typed-up manuscript upon which their critique is based. In the same session, a third group will start a new topic and give an introduction. All groups have to serve both as A and B for at least one time this semester. All groups will have to let me know their topic by the end of the 4th week. Group 2, 3, or 4 must do a Taiwan or Chinese-language film related topic.\n\n_Grading Policy_\n\nthe final debate will account for 15% of your total grade\n\nattendance and _manners_ for 15%\n\nperformance as a member of group A in presentation: 20%\n\nperformance as a member of group A in leading a discussion group: 25%\n\nperformance as a member of group B: 8%\n\nperformance as a peer-discussant (non-group A): 17%.\n\n_Requirements_\n\n1.  Attendance at all sessions is mandatory.\n\n2.  You receive _a hefty penalty or even failing grade_ if\n\n        you eat in class\n\nyou have 5 or more unexcused absences\n\nyou or your electronic device, in any way, causes disturbance or interruption in class\n\n        you commit _plagiarism_ of any form\n\n3.  Limit on-line references to _2/3_ of your research materials.\n\nSchedule subject to change to accommodate new teaching plans or teaching practicum\n\nWeek 1 Feb 18\n\nintroduction and syllabus\n\n_the sorting hat: a new group_\n\nWeek 2 Feb 25        the final debate\n\nscreen:                     _hu die_ (Yan Yan Mak, 2004)\n\nfinal debate of 2012\n\ndue                          research materials for final debate\n\nWeek 3 Mar 4          presentation\n\ntopic 1                    \n\ngroup 1                    \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWeek 4 Mar 11        discussion\n\ngroup 1\n\nWeek 5 Mar 18       \n\nscreen:                     _The Great Debaters_ (Denzel Washington, 2007)\n\nWeek 6 Mar 25 (27)        FINAL DEBATE\n\nWeek 7 Apr 1          critique + presentation\n\ncritique of g1 by g4\n\ng4                            \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\ntopic 2                    \n\ng2                            \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWeek 8 Apr 8          discussion\n\ng 2\n\nWeek 9 Apr 15        lecture: film\n\ncritique of g2 by g1\n\nWeek 10 Apr 22      discussion\n\nWeek 11 Apr 29      presentation\n\ntopic 3                     \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\ngroup 3                    \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWeek 12 May 6       discussion\n\ng3\n\nWeek 13 May 13     critique + presentation\n\ncritique of g3 by g2\n\ntopic 4                     \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWeek 14 May 20     discussion\n\ndiscussion led by g4\n\nWeek 15 May 27     film talk (tentative)\n\nguest speaker                   陳俊蓉（金馬影展國際組總監）\n\ncritique of g4 by g3\n\nWeek 16 Jun 3         film talk (tentative)\n\nguest speaker                   劉蔚然（原子映象負責人）\n\nWeek 17 Jun 10       film talk (tentative)\n\nguest speaker                   陳駿霖（《一頁台北》導演）",
