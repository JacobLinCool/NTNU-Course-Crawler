    "syllabus": " **Intermediate Listening and Speaking - Spring 2022**\n\n**Time:** Thursday, 10:20-12:10                    **Classroom:** 誠701A\n\n**Objectives**: This course is designed to **cultivate student listening skills** on natural and real-life English, from a variety of sources like TV news, radio broadcasts, and simulated daily conversations. In so doing, there will be **a five-pronged approach** to the course:\n\n**1)** Firstly, occasionally there will also be **supplementary materials**. These will vary over a range of areas and topics so that students can to familiarize themselves with the language spoken in various realistic settings while also discussing up-to date issues.  \n\n**2)** Secondly, **the course textbook** is designed to improve listening comprehension skills for academic purposes while focusing on listening to general interest topics in English. There is also an **online lab** that dovetails with the book.\n\n**3)** Thirdly, there will be **a task-based project** element to the course, whereby the student groups will be able to create **a class listening exercise**, and then teach it to the class.\n\n**4)** Fourthly, there will also be **an online workshop** in the second half of the course whereby students will be asked to do an online course in English of their choice within their area of study or interest.\n\n**5)** Finally, **Autonomous Listening Practice.** Students should **practice listening and speaking** outside of class every chance they get.
