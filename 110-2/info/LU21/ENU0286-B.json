Curran, Office: 誠714\n\n**Office Hours:** Tuesdays, 10:00 – 12:00; Thursdays, 10:00 – 12:00   \n\n**Email: curran.jean@gmail.com**\n\n**Goals**\n=========\n\nThis is the second semester of a year-long course. During this semester we will continue to build upon the skills discussed and practiced last semester.  These skills include predicting, listening for the main idea, listening for details, critical listening, and vocabulary development. The organization of the course and the materials used will be similar to last semester.\n\n**Materials**\n\nPreiss, Sherry. (2015). _North Star Listening and Speaking, Level 5_ (Fourth Edition). White Plains, NY: Pearson Education.\n\n**Requirements**\n================\n\n**1.  Attendance and Preparation**: This is a skill-based course. It is expected that you will attend class weekly to practice your listening skills. If you miss class frequently, points will be deducted from your final grade for the course. Please arrive for class on time.  If you are late on a regular basis, points will be deducted from your final grade for the course. If it is necessary for you to be late, please enter the classroom quietly. Prior to class, please prepare the readings and vocabulary that accompany the chapters in the textbook.\n\n**2.  Participation**: Although this class focuses on the development of listening skills, it is also expected that you will be an active participant in the learning process.  You should be a critical listener, and contribute to any classroom discussions of the listening topics.\n\n**3.  Listening to a Longer Program**: Everyone is required to listen to one longer program from the BBC. After listening to the program, you should submit a written report about it.  \n\n**4.  A Favorite Source for Your Journals**: Each student will be asked to introduce a source of listening materials to our class and explain (briefly) why you like this particular source. After giving your presentation, you should submit a report on the source.\n\nGrading\n\nFinal grades will be assigned based on a combination of exam scores (2), the report on the BBC longer program, introduction of a new source, and other journal assignments.                            \n\n**Advanced Listening—Syllabus—Spring Semester 2022**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n                                     **Topic**\n\nHomework Date Due\n\n1\n\nFebruary 15\n\nFebruary 17\n\n### Orientation to the Second Semester of the Course\n\n**North Star—Unit 5**: “Business Not as Usual”\n\n2\n\nFebruary 22\n\nFebruary 24\n\n**North Star—Unit 5**: “Business Not as Usual”\n\n3\n\nMarch 1 March 3\n\n**North Star—Unit 5**: “Business Not as Usual”\n\n4\n\nMarch 8\n\nMarch 10\n\nListening to Academic Lectures—Notetaking Skills\n\n5\n\nMarch 15\n\nMarch 17\n\n**North Star—Unit 6**: “Together Alone”\n\n6\n\nMarch 22\n\nMarch 24\n\n**North Star—Unit 6**: “Together Alone”\n\n7\n\nMarch 29\n\nMarch 31\n\nListening to Academic Lectures—Notetaking Skills\n\n8\n\nApril 5\n\nApril 7\n\nListening to Academic Lectures—Notetaking Skills\n\n### Holiday—Spring Vacation\n\n9\n\nApril 12\n\nApril 14\n\n**MIDTERM EXAM**\n\nLast day to submit\n\nJ1 and J2\n\n10\n\nApril 19\n\nApril 21\n\nListening to Academic Lectures—Notetaking Skills\n\n11\n\nApril 26\n\nApril 28\n\nMOVIE\n\n12\n\nMay 3\n\nMay 5\n\nNorth Star—Unit 7: “Learning Through the Arts”\n\n13\n\nMay 10\n\nMay 12\n\nNorth Star—Unit 7: “Learning Through the Arts”\n\n14\n\nMay 17\n\nMay 19\n\n**North Star—Unit 8:**\n\n“Microfinance: Changing Lives for $50”\n\n15\n\nMay 24\n\nMay 26\n\n**North Star—Unit 8:**\n\n“Microfinance: Changing Lives for $50”\n\nTake-Home Assignment\n\n16\n\nMay 31\n\nJune 2\n\n**FINAL EXAM**\n\nLast day to submit\n\nJ3 and J4\n\n17\n\nJune 7\n\nJune 9\n\nTake-Home Assignment: \n\n“BBC Documentary or Discovery Program”\n\n18\n\nJune 14\n\nJune 16\n\nTake-Home Assignment: \n\n“BBC Documentary or Discovery Program”\n\nDocumentary or Discovery Assignment\n\n_Jean E.
