    "syllabus": "**Time:** Thursdays, 3:30-5:20            **Classroom:** 誠305\n\n**Objectives**: The goal of this course is to **enhance students’ English-speaking competence output** by **broadening their scope** of English conversation and **enhancing their communication skills in real-life situations**. At the same time, it will try to **build confidence** and **motivate** them to **actively participate in English conversation autonomously**. In order to do so, there will again be a **five-pronged approach** to the course this semester:\n\n1.  Firstly, the **course textbook** presents natural language in authentic contexts, and helps **develop conversation management strategies**.\n\n1.  Secondly, there will also be **supplementary materials**. These will vary over a range of areas and at appropriate times, so that students can to familiarize themselves with topical language spoken in various popular settings.\n\n1.  Thirdly, over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a **panel discussion task-based project**, in which task groups are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are of interest to them, and then **orally** **present their findings** as a group to the class**.**\n\n1.  Fourthly, over the course of the second-half of the semester, there will be an emphasis on **teaching practice** in relation to conversation**.** In pairs or groups of three, students will **plan a 30-minute+ lesson** in a series of stages and then **teach the lesson to the class.** Learning how to plan a conversation class will provides students with a real-life experience and real interface between being a student and becoming a member of the teaching profession.\n\n1.  Finally, students need to **practice speaking** **English** outside of class. All significant autonomous English-language encounters (at least **six experiences**) should be **recorded in a notebook/portfolio** and handed in at the end of the semester.\n\n**N.B.
