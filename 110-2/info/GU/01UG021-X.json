Films and literary works explored in this course range from film adaptations of literary masterpieces, films of critical sociological, cultural, and literary concern, and the written texts of literary works proper. By guiding them into undertaking in-depth, critical analysis of representations of the visual and the verbal, this course aims to broaden students’ worldview and hence their humanistic vision. It is hoped that by the end of the semester, students will acquire the comprehensive knowledge of literature and film with the aid of a thorough grasp of cultural and historical contexts; meanwhile, by analyzing literary works and their film adaptations, students may compare different ways of representations in cinematic and written texts. We hope to draw more students’ interest back to literature by watching films; on the other hand, we also expect students to be more critically aware of the lure of contemporary media and therefore are able to see film adaptations of literary works as socio-cultural processes involving issues of representation, production, and consumption.\n\n**Tentative** **Course Schedule**\n\nInstructor\n\n蘇榕  Su, Jung\n\nTeaching Contents (including topics of each week)\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nAssigned Reading**/**Class Activities\n\nTheme\n\n1\n\n2/17\n\nOrientation; “What is Plagiarism?”\n\nIntroduction and course requirements\n\n2\n\n2/24\n\n_The Remains of the Day_\n\nAging and Retrospection\n\n3\n\n3/3\n\n_The Remains of the Day_\n\nAging and Retrospection\n\n4\n\n3/10\n\nInvited Speaker\n\nTBA\n\n5\n\n3/17\n\n_Go Grandriders_\n\nEnjoying the Senior Age\n\n6\n\n3/24\n\n_Pushing Hands_\n\nAging and Cross-culture\n\n7\n\n3/31\n\n_Still Human_\n\nAging and Disability\n\n8\n\n4/7\n\n_Still Human_\n\nAging and Disability\n\n9\n\n4/14\n\n_The Intern_\n\nIntergenerational Relationship\n\n10\n\n4/21\n\n_The Intern_\n\nIntergenerational Relationship\n\n11\n\n4/28\n\n_The White Countess_\n\nCosmopolitanism and the Orphan Image\n\n12\n\n5/5\n\n_The White Countess_\n\nCosmopolitanism and the Orphan Image\n\n13\n\n5/12\n\n_Dirty Pretty Things_\n\nThe City and Migrant Workers\n\n14\n\n5/19\n\n_Pinoy Sunday_\n\nThe City and Migrant Workers\n\n15\n\n5/26\n\nRecapitulation\n\nReview of the films and assigned readings\n\n16\n\n6/2\n\nFinal Exam\n\n\\*\n\n\\*Microfilm screening and evaluation (Limit your film to 5-10 minutes.)\n\n \\*Optional (bonus points added)\n\n\\*\n\n\\* Individual Conference\n\n\\*Please register for the conference in the 12th week in Moodle.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**III Grading Policy****:**\n\n1\\.
