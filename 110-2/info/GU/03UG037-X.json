Week 17-18 will be self-learning. \n\nTo fully understand how this course works, **first week attendance is REQURIED**. \n\n**Course Description:** Education of Sustainable Development is holistic and transformational education that addresses learning content and outcomes, pedagogy and the learning environment. It is a shift from teaching to learning. The course creates interactive, learner-centered teaching and learning settings with project-based learning approaches and design thinking methods. Sustainable development goals serve as conceptual lenses for the projects.\n\n**Course Outcomes**\n\n**Corresponding to the Core Goal**\n\n1\n\nto develop the awareness of environmental literacy for citizens and explore the urgent issues of the globe\n\n2. multicultural and international perspectives\n\n6\\. active inquiry and lifelong learning\n\n2\n\nto care the disadvantaged and to critically think about the social justice to become a transformational intellectualist \n\n2\\. multicultural and international perspectives\n\n3\\. critical reflection and humanity\n\n3\n\nto exercise one’s agency to promote social justice with practices as modern citizens\n\n1. communication and collaboration\n\n7.innovative leadership and problem solving\n\n8. social caring and citizenship practices\n\n**General Syllabus**\n\n**Schedule**\n\n1.  Reviewing course outline\n2.  Introducing sustainable development goals, SDGs \n3.  Exploring current international education platforms. Selecting themes of projects. \n4.  Focusing on background information on SDGs. Demonstrating media literacy and critical thinking skills to process information. \n5.  (A) Empathy: Workshop of design thinking: empathy. Empathy is crucial to a human-centered design processsuch as Design Thinking, and empathy allows design thinkers to set aside their own assumptions about the world in order to gain insight into users and their needs. (B) define: Put together the information created and gathered during the Empathies stage. Analyze observations and synthesize them in order to define the core problems that you and your team have identified up to this point. You should seek to define the problem as a problem statement in a human-centered manner.\n6.  (C) Ideate: Ready to start generating ideas. Start to look for alternative ways of viewing the problem. (D) Prototype: The design team will now produce a number of inexpensive, scaled down versions of the product or specific features found within the product, so they can investigate the problem solutions generated in the previous stage. \n7.

Test: used to _redefine_ one or more problems and inform the _understanding_ of the users, the conditions of use, how people think, behave, and feel, and to empathise. Even during this phase, alterations and refinements are made in order to rule out problem solutions and derive as deep an understanding of the product and its users as possible.Setting objectives of projects, timeline and the model of collaboration \n11.
