    "syllabus": "This course will be taught entirely in English\n\nThis course aims to introduce students to three selected topics in modern Southeast Asian history and culture, from late 19th century to early 21st century. Through weekly discussions, students are challenged to reexamine the cultural and historical contexts of these topics. Students will also need to critique and reflect on the topics discussed, formulating personal insights on the topics at hand. While prior knowledge in Southeast Asian history and culture is not required, some background knowledge will be helpful. By the end of the course, students should possess not only a general understanding of the complex nature of these historical events but also the ability to think critically regarding history and culture. \n\nThe course will be conducted entirely in English. Students will be required to participate in classroom discussions in English. The course will also involve extensive reading of academic papers/works, and writing of academic reports. \n\nWeek 1.
