    "syllabus": "**Descriptions**\n\nThis course is designed to introduce to students the fundamental elements of short stories with a “problem-based learning” (PBL) pedagogy. Each week, the class activity centers on a problem in relation to the assigned reading for students to discuss and resolve in a group. In the second half of the semester, it will feature selected masterpieces of short stories. Overall, it aims to deliver literature via interactive learning environments such as group discussions, problem solving, video viewing, individual research, play and performance arts, etc. The goals are to get students familiar with the fundamental elements of the short story as a sub-genre of literature and interested in the making and delivering of a good story. Moreover, it provides students with the opportunity to collectively work on a short story and present the content in a most creative and technologically enhanced manner. Ultimately, it hopes to connect the reading of short stories with the delivery (telling) of a good story, underscoring the significance of storytelling in literature and in life.   \n\n**Objectives**\n\nTo cultivate the appreciation of short stories, including history, features, and appreciation\n\nTo develop “problem-based learning” techniques in a group\n\nTo motivate students to work on language art in the creation of a good story with peers\n\nTo stimulate students to deliver the story in technologically-enhanced presentations\n\n**Grouping and LINE Group**\n\nThe class will be grouped by 5 and please elect someone to be the Group Leader (GL).
