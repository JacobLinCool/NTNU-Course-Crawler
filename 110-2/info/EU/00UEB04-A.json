    "syllabus": "Bilingual Teaching Practicum is a hands-on practicum for pre-service bilingual teachers in the NTNU. It offers students an opportunity to gain more classroom experience, and to develop and apply their teaching ideas in the classroom. In this semester, students will learn to develop useful strategies for teaching content/language to middle school students. They will also learn to write well-structured lesson plans and to improve their own teaching skills. Classroom activities mainly include lectures, invited talks, classroom observations, and micro-teaching.\n\n[the syllabus](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=9c2d4dc27b644dc589b47e8f67256a86&fno=80fdbe69edb24f4ba75d81ec1d2266a6)",
