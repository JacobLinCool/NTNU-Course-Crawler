    "description": "Patents are the protection of the rights of inventors, designers and creators to their inventions. Patents guarantee that no one else can benefit from their inventions. It is a way to protect the inventor's industrial or intellectual property rights. When inventors apply for patents for their innovations, one of their goals is to achieve maximum internationalization of their patents. In order for them to be protected in different countries, the original patent must be translated into the language of the jurisdiction in which the invention will be sold. \n\n     This practical course is designed to teach students how to translate Chinese patents into English. Emphasis will be placed on the appropriate language register and format of the target text, as well as how to handle technical information that is often found in the source text. Student assignments will include the translation of several patents and other relevant documents.\n\n\n\nClasses will be conducted as follows:\n(1) A weekly translation exercise of about 600 words/characters long. At least 10 exercises during the term. Depending upon the size of the class, students may be assigned to work in groups of two.\n(2) Source-language texts will include select articles on science and technology. Handouts or relevant online links will be given to students for prior reading before doing their translation assignments.\n(3) Weekly translation projects submitted by students will be discussed in class, including analysis of mistranslations, omissions, corrections and improvements. \n(4) Emphasis of student-work analysis: accuracy, grammar, diction, vocabulary, tone, language register, style and format. \n(5) Peer Review: Students will be regularly assigned to study and comment on the work of their classmates as a means to learn others�� adopted techniques, as well as consider their pros and cons, in comparison with their own work. Class discussion will combine students' peer review comments and corrections/suggestions made by the professor. Due to time constraints, it would not be possible to thoroughly review the complete translation works of students, for which they are encourage to compare their versions with those of their classmates. Students thus learn how to translate through their own assigned work, comparison with those of their classmates and comments made by the professor.",
