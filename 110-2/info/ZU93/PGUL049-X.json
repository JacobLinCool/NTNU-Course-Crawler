    "description": "This course is designed to introduce to the students fantasy literature, with emphasis on two essential concepts: innocence and reality. To better understand the multicultural heritage embedded in the literary texts, we will have recourse to several contemporary theories, such as feminism, gender studies, postmodernism, eco-criticism, globalization, and post-humanism. In an age of information technology where almost every kind of knowledge is on the Internet, fantasy literature play a crucial role to show not so much the restoration of Edenic innocence and the inspiration of realistic experience, as the invention of culturally-modified innocence and the making of epiphanization in realistic experience.",
