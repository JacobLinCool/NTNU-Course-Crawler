    "syllabus": "**_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**\n\nSpring 2022: This is a co-taught course among Mississippi State University (MSU), National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), and National Taiwan University (NTU). Faculty and students in these universities will participate in the course via videoconferencing. The emerging discipline of molecular nutrition encompasses nutritional biochemistry, nutritional genomics, nutritional metabolomics, and epigenetics. The course focuses on the effects of diet and nutrients on an individual’s genome and metabolism, and how the molecular events affect human health. This course is a lecture course designed to acquaint senior undergraduate and graduate students with current concepts, knowledge and strategies for understanding molecular nutrition.\n\nSpring 2022: February 15 to May 3; Tuesday and Thursday 8:00 AM-10:00 AM.\n\nClassroom: Room 101, Cheng Building, main campus of NTNU 校本部（和平東路一段162號） 誠101教室\n\n**_LECTURE TOPICS_** \n\n1\\. 2/15 Introduction (knowing each other and course introduction)\n\n2\\. 2/17 Maternal nutrition\n\n3\\. 2/22 Nutrition programming and microbiota\n\n4\\. 2/24 Molecular nutrition and aging\n\n5\\. 3/01 Folate nutrition in cancer prevention and prognosis: from basic research to clinical application\n\n6\\. 3/03 Molecular anticancer mechanisms of nutraceutical compounds\n\n7\\. 3/08 Molecular biology of selenium\n\n8\\. 3/10 Signaling transduction in cancer cell death by nutraceutical     compounds\n\n    _3/15 and 3/17 Spring break at MSU_\n\n9\\. 3/22 Epigenetic regulation\n\n10\\. 3/24 Amino acid metabolism\n\n11\\. 3/29 Nutrient excess and diabetes\n\n12\\. 3/31 Obesity and colon cancer\n\n      _4/5 Spring break at NTNU and NTU_\n\n13\\. 4/7 Foodomics\n\n14\\. 4/12 Food microbiology\n\n15\\. 4/14 **Group discussion-1 (in class)**\n\n     _4/19 Easter Monday at MSU_\n\n16\\. 4/21 **Oral presentation-1**\n\n     _4/26 Group discussion-2_\n\n17\\. 4/28 **Oral presentation-2**\n\n18\\. 5/3 **Exam**",
