The course contains three main topics: (a) a feasibility study, which is normally conducted by the developers to analyze the market situation and confirm the potential return and financial performance; (b) project management, which involves the coordination of a project��s construction process to ensure the project is delivered on time, on budget and at the proper level of quality; and (c) hotel design considerations. At the completion of this course, students should be able to:\n\n1. Know the framework and models through which the development of hospitality facilities is accomplished\n\n2. Know the major planning and design considerations for hospitality facilities\n\n3. Understand the key factor affecting a construction project management \n\n4. Form judgments on typical development and planning decisions",
