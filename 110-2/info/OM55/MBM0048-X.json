    "description": "The course extends financial decision-making to the international setting. Topics include the foreign exchange market, predicting exchange rate movements, hedging exposures with various derivative and other alternatives, the challenges of raising funds internationally and the process and documents of international trade. The course makes extensive use of case studies and there is an expectation that students will make recommendations to real life problems and justify their decisions. This is a challenging course with a significant theory content which requires class attendance and participation in addition to the appropriate independent study and thought to be successful. \nThe first half of the course covers the determination of foreign exchange rates, and the basics of trading in financial markets and governmental exchange rate policy. The second half, which is the focus of the course, deals with the impact of foreign currency exchanges and global capital markets on firms’ investment, financing, and risk management policies. We also discuss currency speculation strategies and the impact of monetary policy on exchange rates.",

    "syllabus": "*   Week 1 (from 15th Feb) and Week 2 are self-study (no class)\n*   Week 3 (1st March) to Week 6 (22nd March) Teaching online,08:10am~12:10pm.( **Lecturing hours: 4)**\n\nGoogle Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/vzz-sedr-uku\n\n*   Week 4: March 8 (no class)\n*   Week 7 (March 29) to Week 18 (June 18) teaching in person,09:10~12:10pm.( **Lecturing hours: 3)**\n*   Week 8 (5th April) is public holiday, no class.\n\n**NOTES:**\n\n*    Instead of lecturing a total of 3 hours each week, I will probably be covering 4 hours a week to go over the self-study materials and ensure good comprehension of the first 5 chapters. Some of this material really sells itself: it is very fascinating. Other elements of international finance, however, are a bit more bland. As such, we must acknowledge that we might have to push ourselves at times to learn this material.\n*    I will cover a great number of chapters quite thoroughly, but you should not expect that I will cover each page of each chapter during lecture discussions. Additionally, many of the issues will build off the material in the text. As such, you should think of the book as a resource guide.  The course outline listed below at this syllabus shows the assign chapters out of the text that you should read to get you up to speed on the topic of each week. \n*    At certain points in the course, it may make good sense to modify the course content described in this syllabus. The instructor reserves the right to modify elements of the course and will notify students accordingly (in class and post any changes in the course website).\n\n**Topic**\n\n**Chapter**\n\n**Week**\n\nSyllabus Class/Introduction\n\nCh.1 & 2\n\nW1: February 15\n\nNo class, self-study\n\nInternational Financial Management & The International Monetary System\n\nCh.1 & 2\n\nW2: February 22\n\nNo class, self-study\n\nInternational Financial Management/The Foreign Exchange Market\n\nCh.1, 2 & 5\n\nW3: March 1\n\nTeaching online\n\nInternational Parity Conditions\n\nCh.6\n\nW4: March 8\n\nNo class\n\nInternational Parity Conditions\n\nCh.6\n\nW5: March 15\n\nTeaching online\n\nBalance of Payments\n\nCh.3\n\nW6: March 22\n\nTeaching online\n\nTutorial Question- Midterm Exam Review\n\nAll covered materials\n\nW7: March 29\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\n**N/A**\n\nAll covered materials\n\nW8: April 5\n\nPublic holiday, no class\n\n**MID-TERM EXAM**\n\nAll covered materials\n\nW9: April 12-Exam will be held in the classroom.\n\nCurrency Derivatives\n\nInterest Rate Derivatives\n\nCh.7& Ch.14\n\nW:10 April 19\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nExchange Rate Exposure I: Transaction and Translation Exposure\n\nCh.8 &10\n\nW11: April 26\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nExchange Rate Exposure II: Economic Exposure\n\nCh.9\n\nW12: May 3\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nInternational Portfolio Theory and Diversification\n\nCh.15\n\nW13: May 10\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nCost & Availability of Capital and Political Risk\n\nCh.12, 13, &17\n\nW14: May 17\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nInternational Capital Budgeting\n\nCh.18\n\nW15: May 24\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nGroup Project Presentation\n\nAssigned group project\n\nW16: May 31\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\nFinal Exam Review\n\nAll covered materials\n\nW17: June 7\n\nTeaching in the classroom\n\n**Final Exam**\n\nAll covered materials\n\nW18: June 14\n\nTeaching in the classroom",

Please consult the course plan that accompanies this syllabus and the Blackboard or Canvas site for this course to see a list of class preparation assignments by topic.\n\nAdditional readings, lecture notes, and problem sets will be posted on the course web (Blackboard or Canvas).

Five percent of your grade includes your discussion and the points you add to the class discussion, your role in class and overall participation."

To personalize the class to student experiences, I might ask a student or two about their jobs and use those examples to discuss finance concepts like decision making under uncertainty. I truly believe if students do not see a variety of ways in which finance concepts can be applied to the real world they will fail to see how it matters to them."

Groups of two people must be\nformed and should stay together until the end of semester. Each group could choose a topic by\nthemselves. The topics should be related to the material discussed in class, and address issues faced by companies operating in the market. There are many interesting topics in which students can examine:\n1.\tThe economic implications of the Israeli-Arab normalization agreements\n2.\tTrans-Pacific Partnership or the impact of Brexit. \n3.\tTaiwan’s gross domestic product (GDP). Taiwan’s annual GDP growth rate was 0.72% in 2015, much lower than that of other countries in Asia. How would that affect the Taiwan dollar? \n4.\tHow Donald Trump’s presidency affected the US dollar. Strengthen or weaken the US dollar? \n5.\tHave you ever come across the argument that Germany benefits from the Euro while other Euro countries pay? Why? Or why not?\n6. Why did The Turkish Lira falls more than 4% against the dollar? \n7. What caused hyperinflation in Venezuela? Why Venezuela's currency continues to collapse?"
