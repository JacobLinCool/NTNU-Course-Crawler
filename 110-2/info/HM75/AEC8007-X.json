    "description": "Nowadays intelligent control techniques are successfully used in many control applications. The course focuses on providing an introduction to the emerging area of intelligent control and optimization using a control-engineering approach. It includes state-of-the-art intelligent control approaches such as fuzzy, neural network, fuzzy-neural, hybrid structure, and adaptive approaches. Through various examples, students will learn how to apply intelligent control techniques to real engineering problems with python and matplotlib.",
