    "description": "Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing areas of Life Science in 21st century and is also at the cutting edge of both technical and conceptual advances in the biology. For studying Neuroscience, a firm background in Neurobiology such as how sensory system, motor system and cognitive system functioned will be required. In addition, students will also need to understand the basic knowledge including molecules, cells, neural networks, brain structure and behavior. This course will provide the fundamentals of neural function at all these levels. Briefly, this course will proceed from the basic biological properties of neurons and glial cells, to the physiological basis of learning, memory, sensory processing, emotion, motivation, drug addiction and psychiatric disorders. Throughout the course stress will be placed on methods and concepts rather than facts alone. Examples and case studies will be provided and discussed in this course.",
