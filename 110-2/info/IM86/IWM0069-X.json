        "隨者東西冷戰的結束與國際共產集團的式微，國際關係的體質產生了巨大的變化。全球所關注的安全焦點已轉為經濟貿易、環境、能源、恐怖主義等議題，非軍事性因素被廣泛納入國家安全的概念中思考；區域經濟整合機制的出現，反映各國對其安全意涵擴大的構思。",
        "為避免台灣在全球，特別是東南亞被邊陲化的危機，本課程研究核心分為：台灣經濟發展、中國經濟發展及兩岸經貿互動等三個單元。我國面對貿易全球化時代的來臨，兩岸經貿關係的穩定擴大，不僅影響兩岸關係之互動與發展，亦將影響我國與其他地區之經貿互動。",
        "非屬傳統規範的國家安全因素，應予以重新界定，並納入國家安全意涵中，方能達成我國家安全長久利益之目標。",
        "面對經貿全球一體化的時代來臨，區域經濟整合不僅是攸關技術、資本在區域或國際市場間的高速流動，更包括以管理與策略性高級人力資本的跨國移動。本專題研究重點係針對新興的亞太地區國家為主軸針對區域性人力資源如何轉變為人力資本進行深入探索。"
