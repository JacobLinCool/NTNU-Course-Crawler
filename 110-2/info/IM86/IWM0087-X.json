    "description": "This course focuses on studies in workplace communications related to the HR function. HR personnel frequently use communication to carry out important job duties such as policy announcement, project presentation, job description, employee interviews, training delivery, performance feedback, bargaining and negotiation, etc. Some communications involve sensitive or private information; some are difficult (e.g., exit interviews, misconduct investigation, counseling on special conditions, etc.) Miscommunication often leads to employee dissatisfaction and low organizational efficiency. Therefore, effective communication becomes a critical issue for HR personnel, which takes a combination of appropriate media, environment, and skills. This course will cultivate graduate students’ ability to study workplace communication through discussion of issues, review of research methods, and development of related research.",
