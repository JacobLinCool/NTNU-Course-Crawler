        "This course aims to give students an in-depth understanding and examination of ecocriticism. Tracing its roots to Christian theology, ecocriticism has become one of the most productive and provocative discourses in contemporary theories.",
        "The course aims to introduce students to the major issues and polemics in ecocriticism, including the historical overview, discursive inceptions, environmental imagination, deep ecology, postcolonial ecology, animal ethics, eco-cosmopolitanism and the materialist turn in ecocriticism."
