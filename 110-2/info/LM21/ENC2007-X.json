    "syllabus": "Course objective\n\nThis course is intended to establish a foundation for further research in Chinese generative grammar. Such being the case, it is concerned with the issues and topics which have been of central significance in the recent development of Chinese syntax. The main reading material for this course is “The Syntax of Chinese” by Huang, Li and Li (2009), supplemented by other important works, both classical and up-to-date, in Chinese syntax. This course will enhance the understanding of Universal Grammar by exploring the syntactic mechanism of Chinese and therefore will benefit students who are interested in syntactic theory, Chinese syntax or interfaces between syntax and other linguistic areas (such as sentence processing, L1 or L2 acquisition, etc.) in Chinese.\n\nCLASS CALENDAR (subject to change): (1st ~16th weeks physical classes + 4th, 10th weeks Saturday project work = 18 weeks)\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nTopic\n\n1\n\n02/15/22\n\nIntroduction\n\n2\n\n02/22/22\n\nHLL 1: Categories\n\n3\n\n03/01/22\n\nHLL 2: Argument structure\n\n4\n\n03/08/22\n\nStudent presentation\n\n_4_\n\n_03/12/22_\n\n_Project work (I)_\n\n5\n\n03/15/22\n\nHLL 3: Verb phrases\n\n6\n\n03/22/22\n\nHLL 4: The _bei_ construction\n\n7\n\n03/29/22\n\nStudent presentation\n\n8\n\n04/05/22\n\nSpring break\n\n9\n\n04/12/22\n\nHLL 6: Topics and relatives\n\n10\n\n04/19/22\n\nStudent presentation\n\n_10_\n\n_04/23/22_\n\n_Project work (II)_\n\n11\n\n04/26/22\n\nOral presentation of the Progress report\n\n12\n\n05/03/22\n\nHLL 7: Questions\n\n13\n\n05/10/22\n\nHLL 8: Nominal expressions\n\nStudent presentation\n\n14\n\n05/17/22\n\nIndividual appointments\n\n15\n\n05/24/22\n\nOral presentation of term paper.\n\n16\n\n05/31/22\n\nTerm paper due",
