    "syllabus": "**Course Description:**\n\nThis course aims to help students develop critical analytical skills to re-read the local and global society through appreciating contemporary western drama. The readings selected in this course focus on those voices or lives lesser heard. The course approaches drama from various theoretical lenses of difference, such as feminism, queer studies, critical race studies, and disability studies. The course is divided into three major sections: (1) representations of violence against women on stage, (2) contemporary adaptations of Euripides’s _Medea_ in Chicanx theatre, (3) staging of non-normative bodies in freak shows. In each major section, students are invited to adopt a comparative perspective to examine paired plays to identify the convergence, divergence, tension, and/or extension between the readings in order to understand a topic in depth.\n\n**Tentative Weekly Schedule:** _The instructor may make changes to the schedule before the first class._\n\n**\\[16+2 weeks\\]**\n\n**Introduction to the course**\n\nWeek 1\n\n2/17\n\nIntroduction to the course\n\nWeek 2\n\n2/24\n\n*   Selection from Sue-Ellen Case’s _Feminism and Theatre_\n\n**Unit 1: Body Politics, Monologues, Documentary Theatre**\n\nWeek 3\n\n3/3\n\n*   Eve Ensler’s _The Vagina Monologues_\n\nWeek 4\n\n3/10\n\n*   Humberto Robles’s “Women of Sand: Testimonios of Women in Ciudad Juárez”: [https://mujeresdearenateatro.blogspot.com/p/woman-of-sand.html](https://mujeresdearenateatro.blogspot.com/p/woman-of-sand.html)\n*   Kalina Brabeck’s “Testimonio: A Strategy for Collective Resistance, Cultural Survival and Building Solidarity”\n\nWeek 5\n\n3/17\n\n*   **_Presentation & Discussion Facilitation 1_**\n\n**Unit 2: Medea Adaptations, Chicanx Theatre**\n\nWeek 6\n\n3/24\n\n*   Luis Alfaro’s _Mojada_\n*   (Supplementary) Euripides’s _Medea_\n\n**_Short Essay Option 1 (The Vagina Monologues or Women of Sand) due by 9:10 on Moodle_**\n\nWeek 7\n\n3/31\n\n*   Gloria Anzaldúa’s _Borderlands_ Ch 1, Ch 2, Ch7\n*   Cherríe Moraga’s “Queer Aztlán: The Re-formation of Chicano Tribe”\n\nWeek 8\n\n4/7\n\n*   Cherríe Moraga’s _The Hungry Women_\n\nWeek 9\n\n4/14\n\n*   **_Presentation & Discussion Facilitation 2_**\n\n**Unit 3: Non-Normative Bodies, Freak Shows**\n\nWeek 10\n\n4/21\n\n*   Rosemarie Garland Thompson’s “From Wonder to Error: A Genealogy of Freak Discourse in Modernity” in _Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body_\n\n**_Short Essay Option 2 (Mojada or The Hungry Woman) due by 9:10 on Moodle_**\n\nWeek 11\n\n4/28\n\n*   Bernard Pomerance’s _The Elephant Man_\n\nWeek 12\n\n5/5\n\n*   Suzan-Lori Parks’s _Venus_\n*   Jean Young’s “The Re-Objectification and Re-Commodification of Saartjie Baartman in Suzan-Lori Parks’s _Venus_”\n\nWeek 13\n\n5/12\n\n*   **_Presentation and Discussion Facilitation 3_**\n\n**Final Project**\n\nWeek 14\n\n5/19\n\nFinal project consultation and research week.
