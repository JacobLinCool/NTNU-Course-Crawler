    "syllabus": "**General Course Description**\n\nLanguage education policy is a flourishing field of study. This course focuses more on second/foreign language education policies, which usually exert great influence on teaching and learning languages at schools. We will approach second/foreign language education policy from an interdisciplinary perspective. To build theoretical and conceptual grounds for this course, theories and methodological approaches drawn from various disciplines and fields (especially from the field of language policy and planning/management) will be introduced first. We will then read studies on second/foreign (especially ESL/EFL) education policies in different countries.\n\n**Requirements & Grading**\n\nThe class will be conducted in a seminar format. Under this format, students are expected to thoroughly read the course materials, share their understanding of the materials with the class, and lead discussion on readings they are assigned to report. Students are also encouraged to bring their own interests to the class and share articles or documents related to this course. Most importantly, each student is expected to draw on the theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches outlined in this course to propose a study on an English (or second/foreign language) education policy. To ensure timely completion of the task, you will have to present the policy you plan to explore at the seventh week. The research proposal should contain at least the following elements: (1) research background (i.e., an overview explaining the background of the policy to be examined and relevant literature or theoretical frameworks); (2) purpose of the study (a statement of the research problem, its importance, and what to be achieved through the study) and research questions, if appropriate; and (3) research design. Final course grades will be determined as follows:\n\n1\\. Presentations of course readings (45%)                                                    2. Presentation of an L2 education policy (10%) \n\n3\\. A written research proposal (30%)                                                             4. Attendance and participation (15%)\n\n**Tentative Course Schedule**\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Topic**\n\n1\n\n2/15\n\n**Introduction**\n\n2\n\n2/22\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n3\n\n3/01\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n4\n\n3/08\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n5\n\n3/15\n\nLanguage Policy and Political Issues in Education\n\n6\n\n3/22\n\nLanguage Policy and Political Issues in Education\n\n7\n\n3/29\n\n**Presentation of Your Target Policy**\n\n8\n\n4/05\n\n**No Class (National Holiday)**\n\n9\n\n4/12\n\nResearch Methods in LPP and LEP\n\n10\n\n4/19\n\nResearch Methods in LPP and LEP\n\n11\n\n4/26\n\nResearch Methods in LPP and LEP\n\n12\n\n5/03\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n13\n\n5/10\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n14\n\n5/17\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n15\n\n5/24\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n16\n\n5/31\n\n**Research Proposal Presentation**\n\n17\n\n6/07\n\nCatch-up\n\n18\n\n6/14\n\n**Paper Due**",
