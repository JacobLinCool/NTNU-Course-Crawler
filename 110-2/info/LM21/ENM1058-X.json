We will develop several different skills that are necessary for academic writing at the MA level: (1) interpreting literature, or “primary sources,” through close reading; (2) interpreting academic scholarship or “secondary sources”; (3) conducting research and documenting sources; and (4) bringing together interpretations of primary and secondary sources into a well-organized academic essay. This course takes a team-based approach, with students working together with professors and peers to improve their writing through several different writing-based activities and workshops. In the first semester, students will complete short writing assignments with the ultimate goal of writing a very short academic paper; in the second semester, students will work toward writing (or substantially revising) a complete academic essay and sharing their work in a conference presentation. \n\n\\* This is a one-year seminar for literature-track students in the English department, thus **_the fall semester is a prerequisite._**\n\n**Texts:**\n\n1.  _MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers_ (9th Ed) \n2.
