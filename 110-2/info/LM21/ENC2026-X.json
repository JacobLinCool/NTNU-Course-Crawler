It considers variations of language (in a broad sense) and the socio-cultural factors associated with variations. Among the questions posed in the course are these: How and why do speakers select among the range of linguistic varieties in their repertoire, one language or another, standard or vernacular, regional-sounding or not, formal or casual, gendered in one way or another, and so on? How can such variation be accounted for in a theory of language and society? What kind of knowledge is involved in knowing how to participate in conversations, and how do conversational styles differ from group to group? What are the effects of multilingualism and language contact, for speakers, for communities, and for languages? How and why do standard varieties of languages come to be?\n\nThroughout the course, we will learn a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches to the investigation of sociolinguistic data. We will also gain first-hand experience in data collection and analysis through project assignments. Students are highly encouraged to apply sociolinguistic theories and findings discussed in class to communities with which they have personal experiences.\n\n**Textbooks and Required Readings**\n\n1.
