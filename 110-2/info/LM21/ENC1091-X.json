    "syllabus": "**Seminar on Toni Morrison**\n\n**Spring 2022** \n\nTime: Mondays 2:20 - 5:30 p.m.\n\nClassroom: TBA\n\nInstructor: Prof. Hsiu-chuan Lee (李秀娟)\n\nOffice: 英語系 誠722\n\nOffice hours: Monday 12-2 p.m.; Wed 1-3 p.m., or by appointment\n\nE-mail: [hclee@ntnu.edu.tw](mailto:hclee@ntnu.edu.tw)\n\nCourse Description:\n\nThis seminar takes a single author—the US Nobel laureate Toni Morrison (1931-2019)—as the focus of studies. Students will be introduced to Morrison as one of the greatest contemporary creative writers who told unforgettable stories with global reach, and also as an influential intellectual and literary/cultural critic who sharply engaged with topics as wide-ranging as race, gender, class, histories, languages, and humanity/human relationships in general. Highlighted among the readings for Spring 2022 are Morrison’s first novel _The Bluest Eye_ (1970), her last novel _God Help the Child_ (2015), the Pulitzer Prize-winning _Beloved_ (1987; also chosen by _The New York Times_ as the best work of American fiction from 1981 to 2006), and the lesser-known (yet richly textualized) _Tar Baby_ (1981). We will also read the short story “Racitatif’ (1983), the play _Desdemona_ (2012), texts selected from Morrison’s essay collections and some of the most updated research essays on Morrison and her work. In addition to written texts we will view _Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am_(2019)—a documentary released a few months before Morrison passed away to examine the author’s life, work, major themes and impacts—and clips from the film adaptation of _Beloved_ (1998). Overall, this seminar aims to disclose the richness of Morrison’s oeuvre, probe into the depth and breadth of her thoughts and creativity, and investigate her influences on the global reading and writing of literature. Given the inclusiveness and open-ended nature of this seminar, students are encouraged to close-read Morrison’s writings and explore them from whichever perspective that is of interest. \n\nGrading:\n\n1.  Attendance and participation (25%)\n2.  Oral presentation(s) and leading discussions (20%): 2 times, one leading discussion of a fictional text, and one oral presentation on non-fiction texts\n3.  Weekly one paragraph responses/questions to reading materials on MOODLE (25%): at least 8 responses through the semester; please upload your paragraph unto MOODLE no later than one day prior to the class meeting\n4.  Final Paper (30%)\n\n**Required Texts:**\n\nStudents are required to prepare their own copies of the four novels: _The Bluest Eye_, _Tar Baby_, _Beloved_, and _God Help the Child_ (all editions are acceptable, but Vintage International editions are recommended for those who plan to order new copies).\n\n![](blob:https://courseap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/62aca33a-0f76-42bb-8f0f-497478c9c569)![](blob:https://courseap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/5e73b349-8f44-40db-8fdf-703c3903f166)![](blob:https://courseap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/933c8d58-4436-4786-9c98-64a2df959eb4)![](blob:https://courseap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/db03b113-3083-4c48-878f-d0f098e3a184)\n\nOther materials (shorter texts and selected essays) will be included in a course packet, available for order at讚德行 (台北市大安區師大路 39 巷 28 號 B1; TEL: 2362-0130) after Feb. 14.\n\nTentative Schedule\n\n**(16 in-class meeting weeks + 2 supplementary learning weeks)**\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nContents\n\n1\n\n02/14\n\n(1)An introduction to Toni Morrison and her writings.\n\n(2)Documentary: _Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am_ (2019).\n\n2\n\n02/21\n\n(1)   “Racitatif” (1983), from _The Norton Introduction to Literature_, shorter 13th ed., 2019, pp. 230-244.\n\n(2)   “Behind the Making of _The Black Book_” (1974) and “Rediscovering Black History” (1974) , from _What Moves at the Margin_, pp. 34-55.\n\n3\n\n02/28\n\nObserved holiday\n\n4\n\n03/07\n\n(1) _Desdemona_ (2012) and selected passages from Shakespeare’s _Othello_. \n\n(2) “Intimate Things in Place: A Conversation with Toni Morrison” (1976) and “The Language must Not Sweat: A Conversation with Toni Morrison” (1981), from _Conversations with Toni Morrison_, pp.10-29, pp. 119-128.\n\n5\n\n03/14\n\n1.   _The Bluest Eye_ (1970).\n\n(2)    “Rootedness: The Ancestor as Foundation” (1984), from _What Moves at the Margin_, pp. 56-64.\n\n(3)    “The Site of Memory” (1987), from _Mouth Full of Blood_, pp. 233-245.\n\n6\n\n03/21\n\n1.  _The Bluest Eye_ (1970).\n\n(2) “Unspeakable Things Unspoken: The Afro-American Presence in American Literature” (1988), from _Mouth Full of Blood_, pp.161-197.\n\n7\n\n03/28\n\n(1) _Tar Baby_ (1981).\n\n(2) “Black Matters,” from _Playing in the Dark_ (1992), pp. 1-28.\n\n8\n\n04/04\n\nObserved holiday\n\n9\n\n04/11\n\n(1) _Tar Baby_ (1981).\n\n(1)“Romancing the Shadow,” from _Playing in the Dark_ (1992), pp. 29-59.\n\n10\n\n04/18\n\n(1)_Beloved_ (1987).\n\n(2)“The Nobel Lecture in Literature” (1993) and “The Future of Time: Literature and Diminished Expectations” (1996), from _Mouth Full of Blood_, pp.102-109 and pp. 113-126.\n\n11\n\n04/25\n\n1.  _Beloved_ (1987).\n2.  _Clips from_ the film _Beloved_ (1998; directed by Jonathan Demme).\n\n12\n\n05/02\n\n(1) _God Help the Child_ (2015).\n\n(2) “Romancing Slavery” and “Being or Becoming the Stranger,” from _The Origin of Others_ (2017), pp. 1-39.\n\n13\n\n05/09\n\nClass time changed to 12:00-2:20 to attend the talk by Professor Masumi Izumi (Doshisha University): “Asian Americans and the Black Lives Matter Movement.”\n\n14\n\n05/16\n\n(1) _God Help the Child_ (2015).\n\n(2) “The Color Fetish” and “Configurations of Blackness,” from _The Origin of Others_ (2017), pp. 41-74.\n\n15\n\n05/23\n\nSelected criticisms on Morrison:\n\n(1) Wardi, Anissa Janine. “‘All of Them Colors Was in Me’: Embodiment and Material Ecocriticism.” Introduction in _Toni Morrison and the Natural World: An Ecology of Color_, pp. 3-24.\n\n(2) Roynon, Tessa. “Lobbying the Reader: Toni Morrison’s Recent Forewords to Her Novels.” _European Journal of American Culture_, vol. 33, no. 2, 2014, pp. 85-96.\n\n(3) Leypoldt, Günter. “Degrees of Public Relevance: Walter Scott and Toni Morrison.” _Modern Language Quarterly_, vol. 77, no. 3, 2016, pp. 369-393.\n\n16\n\n05/30\n\nPresentations of final paper ideas.\n\n17\n\nSupplementary Learning\n\nACLA conference (online) June 15-18 (Panel: “Toni Morrison in Global Contexts”).\n\n18\n\nIndividual consultations on the writing of final papers.\n\nFinal Paper Due: 06/27 (Monday)",
