    "syllabus": "英文三:文學與文化（English (III): Literature and Culture）\n\nYi-jo Angel Hsieh (謝伊柔)\n\nhsiehyijo@gmail.com\n\n**\\* Please note that the following schedule and requirements are probably adjusted in accordance with COVID-related policies （因應政府新冠病毒政策的變化，本課程的進度、上課方式、課程要求與評分項目將同時滾動式調整，請同學選課前務必考慮清楚）**\n\n**Course Objectives**\n\nThe course is designed to help students develop their English skills. The aim of this course is thus multifold: to enhance students’ English reading comprehension, to increase their vocabulary by looking at how a given word is used in multiple contexts, and to improve their critical thinking skills through thought-provoking texts. Thus, the required readings cover a wide variety of topics in literature and culture: K-pop music, cancel culture, Harry Potter, detective fiction, etc.. In this semester, students are expected to attend classes regularly, to hand in homework punctually, and to participate actively in class discussion. **Any copy-and-paste content is prohibited in presentations.**\n\n**Course Requirements and Grading**\n\n1.  Attendance and class participation (25%)  \n    In this semester, students have to attend classes regularly and to prepare for class discussion guided through the assigned texts. The course simultaneously encourages them to summarize the major arguments of the readings and express their understanding of the class lectures. **TWO absences** may be allowed without penalty in a situation where students send a formal absence e-mail to the instructor. HOWEVER, absence from **THREE** classes will affect your grade on this part (raw score\\* 0.8). **Students absent from FOUR classes will fail the course.** Arriving 15 minutes late to class counts as absence.  \n     \n2.  Individual Presentation (25%)  \n    Details will be further announced and discussed in the first meeting.  \n     \n    \n3.  Oral Exam (25%)  \n    **The oral exam is scheduled for April 22 (W10) and April 29 (W11).** Based on the required readings, the topics for the exam will be announced a week prior to the exam date. In the exam, each student should answer selected questions from the instructor and the conversation may last about 5 minutes. \n    \n4.  Final Exam (25%)  \n    **The final exam is tentatively scheduled for 27 MAY 2022 (W15).** It consists of true/false, multiple choice, matching item, id questions, and essay questions. Details will be further announced and discussed in the first meeting.\n\n**Class Schedule（preliminary, 16+2 Self-learning weeks）**\n\nW1(0218)-Orientation\n\nW2(0225)-How Did K-Pop Conquer the World?\n\nW2(0304)-How Did K-Pop Conquer the World?\n\nW4(0311)-Harry Potter Series\n\nW5(0318)-Harry Potter Series\n\nW6(0325)-Cancel Culture\n\nW7(0401)-Individual Presentation\n\nW8(0408)-Cancel Culture\n\nW9(0415)-Reading More Dystopian Fiction During the Corona Crisis\n\nW10(0422)-Oral Exam\n\nW11(0429)-Oral Exam\n\nW12(0506)-Reading More Dystopian Fiction During the Corona Crisis\n\nW13(0513)-Sherlock Holmes Is the Archetypal Scientist\n\nW14(0520)-Sherlock Holmes Is the Archetypal Scientist\n\nW15(0527)-Final Exam\n\nW16(0603)-Dragon Boat Festival (No Class)\n\nW17(0610)-Self-learning Week (No Class)\n\nW18(0617)-Self-learning Week (No Class)",
