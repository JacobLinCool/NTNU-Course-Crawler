The selected works will be explored in terms of basic aesthetic elements and critical approaches so as to heighten students’ sensibility of the various dimensions of literary works. Reading literary texts alongside some significant and universal themes is meant to help students develop an in-depth view of literary works as aesthetic expressions of contested social, political, and cultural conditions and as an important means for looking into the complexity of humanity and the human conditions.\n\nII. **Course Requirements and Grading Policy**\n\n1.  **Reading Assignments:** You are expected to complete readings before coming to class.\n2.  **Attendance and Participation (20%):** Attendance and participation in class are required.
