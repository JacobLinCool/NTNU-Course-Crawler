    "syllabus": "**English I - Upper Intermediate - Spring 2022**\n\n**Time:** Monday, 10:20-12:10                    **Classroom:** 公館 S202\n\n**Objectives****:** This course is designed to support college freshmen in their use of **English language in an academic context** through **intensive and extensive reading** and **skill/strategy training**. In addition, it also aims to build student proficiency in the output language skills—**writing and speaking**—through a variety of activities that integrate all four language skills. Therefore, the main objectives of this semester will be to develop students’ **(1)** **fluency in critically expressing ideas** in oral and written forms in English, **(2)** **English presentation skills**, **(3) the TOIEC test** and **(4) autonomous learning skills**. In order to do so, there is a **five-pronged approach** to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** the **course textbook** and **online practice website** consist of a purposefully structured skills and strategies program to **propel language learning** and **create independent learners**. Furthermore, the textbook helps improve **vocabulary learning, reading proficiency** and **develop practical critical thinking.** There will also be four **Chapter Reviews** to quiz student comprehension.\n\n**2)** Secondly, over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake one major **task-based presentation project using Powerpoint,** in which task groups, of no more than 3 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are **of serious interest to themselves**, and then **present their work** to the class.\n\n**3) Thirdly,** students are expected to prepare for and do the **TOEIC LR test** at least. It is **a free test**. The **TOEIC SW** test will also be free for those who score over 785 on the LR test. There will be **no Lexile Test** this semester.\n\n**3) Fourthly,** students will need to do at least **_12 hours_ of** **autonomous learning (around one hour a week)** in total this semester. **TOEIC preparation can be included.** These experiences must be **proven, catalogued and/or recorded** and handed in at the end of the semester**.**\n\n**4) Finally**, there will be a **writing workshop** in which students will be asked to write **a short critical essay** based on class work.\n\n**N.B: All course elements will be evaluated and assessed for final grading**\n\n**Tentative Course Schedule** **(Note:** **This may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion.)**\n\nWk\n\nDate\n\nContent\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n2/14\n\n   Orientation + Table Quiz\n---------------------------\n\n**Register for TOIEC SW**\n\nBring a book next class!\n\n2\n\n2/21\n\n1.
