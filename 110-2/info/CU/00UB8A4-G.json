The aim of this course is thus multifold: to enhance students’ English reading comprehension, to increase their vocabulary by looking at how a given word is used in multiple contexts, and to improve their critical thinking skills through thought-provoking texts. Thus, the selected materials cover a wide variety of topics in _Reading Explorer 2_: food, culture, animals, music, etc.. In this semester, students are expected to attend classes regularly, to hand in homework punctually, and to participate actively in class discussion. **Any copy-and-paste content is prohibited.**\n\n**Delivery of Instruction**\n\n    Lecture, group discussion (Quality Talk), and individual presentation \n\n**Course Requirements and Grading**\n\n1\\. Attendance and Class Participation (25%)\n\n    In this semester, students have to attend classes regularly and to prepare for class discussion guided through the assigned texts. The course simultaneously encourages them to respond critically to questions raised by the texts. The attendance policy allows them to take a leave **TWICE** without penalty only in a situation where they send a formal absence e-mail to me. HOWEVER, absence from **THREE** classes will affect your grade on this part (raw score\\* 0.8). **Students absent from FOUR classes will fail the course.** Late arrival (arriving 15 minutes late to class) counts as absence. **Please note that students are required to turn their cameras on in all online meetings.** \n\n2\\. Reading or Listening Quizzes (10%)\n\n3\\. Three-minute Presentation (20%)\n\n4. Oral Exam (Final) (25%)\n\n5. TOEIC (10%) and Online Learning Resources (10%)\n\nAll Details will be further announced and discussed in the first meeting.\n\n**Class Schedule****（****tentative, 16+2 Self-learning weeks****）**\n\nW1(0218)-Orientation\n\nW2(0225)-The Power of Perfume \n\nW3(0304)-The Power of Perfume / Tips for three-minute presentation\n\nW4(0311)-The Power of Perfume / Friends\n\nW5(0318)-Three-minute Presentation\n\nW6(0325)-Three-minute Presentation\n\nW7(0401)-No Class (the make-up holiday for TOEIC)\n\nW8(0408)-An Incredible Journey\n\nW9(0415)-An Incredible Journey / Friends\n\nW10(0422)-An Incredible Journey\n\nW11(0429)-The Knowledge of Illusion\n\nW12(0506)-The Knowledge of Illusion\n\nW13(0513)-The Knowledge of Illusion\n\nW14(0520)-Oral Exam (Final)\n\nW15(0527)-Oral Exam (Final)\n\nW16(0603)-No Class (Dragon Boat Festival)\n\nW17(0610)-Self-learning week\n\nW18(0617)-Self-learning week",
