    "syllabus": "This course will cover following topics in wireless communication for voice, data, and multimedia. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and standards. It then characterizes the wireless channel, including path loss for different environments, shadowing, and multipath fading. It then examines the capacity limitations and transmission strategies of wireless channels. The next focus will be multicarrier techniques to combat frequency-selective fading and discussing various practical multiple access schemes in wireless systems. The next part of the course is looking over wireless networking and course concludes with discussing different wireless systems and current standards.\n\nTentative Course Syllabus (\\*Subject to changes)\n\nWeek 1: Overview and History of Wireless Communications\n\nWeek 2: Radio Propagation Models\n\nWeek 3: Signal Fading Statistics\n\nWeek 4: Propagation Path-loss Models\n\nWeek 5: Frequency Reuse and Channel Assignment Strategies\n\nWeek 6: Handoff Strategies and System Capacity\n\nWeek 7: Midterm\n\nWeek 8: Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)\n\nWeek 9: Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)\n\nWeek 10: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)\n\nWeek 11: Space Diversion and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (SDMA and CSMA)\n\nWeek 12: Traffic Routing in Wireless Networks\n\nWeek 13: Wireless Network Managements\n\nWeek 14: Wireless LAN: IEEE 802.11\n\nWeek 15: Global System for Mobile (GSM) and CDMA Digital Cellular Standard (IS-95)\n\nWeek 16: Final Exam\n\nWeek 17: Opt.
