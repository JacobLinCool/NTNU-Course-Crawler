    "description": "本課程藉由對其他國家教育發展的認識，拓寬對教育的視野，從更寬廣的角度來思考教育問題。本課程選擇美國、英國、法國、德國、芬蘭、日本、新加坡及中國之教育，分別介紹其社會背景、教育行政與學校教育制度、特色，並就特定主題與各國的教育狀況作對照。另外也討論在全球化脈絡下高等教育和績效責任的重要教育改革議題。\n\nThis course, Comparative Education (CE), is for those who would like to further your understanding of education, prepare for national examinations or have interest in education in various cultural contexts. CE is not a discipline yet, but can be considered as a field of study covering all the disciplines which serve to understand and explain education.\nThis course draws on the education systems of the USA, Germany, Australia, the UK, the Republic of Korea, Finland and Singapore: touching on themes such as historical and social context, educational administration, and formal schooling. In this course, relevant theories and cases are introduced.",
