    "description": "Modern Physiology is both a life science in its own right, and a basic medical science.  Physiology today ?  intends to encompass the study of the functions and integrative processes of life at all levels of structural complexity between the molecular level and that of the whole organism. It includes all organisms, and frames function in evolutionary, environmental, ecological and behavioral contexts. Physiology is an exciting and dynamic discipline that has enormous impact on the quality of human life. Physiology exerts a cross-disciplinary approach to modern science, through which physiologists aim to achieve translation of functional understanding into the health of humans, animals and ecosystems. In particular, the ever increasing understanding of body functions enables identification of novel therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of diseases.",
