    "description": "Computer vision is the problem of extracting scene and object information  from single or sequences of images. Humans receive most of the information about their environment through their eyes. Modelling similar capabilities on a computer is a challenging problem that has received much research attention in the last 40 years. Today, there are many applications of computer vision: automatic mail sorting, analysis of medical images, and self driving cars. The course will present the theoretical underpinnings and the most important applications of computer vision.",
