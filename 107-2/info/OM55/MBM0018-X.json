    "description": "This course is designed to introduce the quantitative methodologies frequently used in the data analysis for marketing decisions. Quantitative marketing research tools and the utility of applying these tools to problem solving and decision-making are introduced. The underlying meaning, constraint, and possible bias stemming from the procedure of data collection and the output of data analysis are emphasized such that class participants are less likely to be subject to the misleading of seemingly scientific data output. The primary topics discussed include regression, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, logit analysis, conjoint analysis, ANOVA/MANOVA, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, structural equation modeling and path analysis. All the class discussions/presentations and paper writings are required in English.",
