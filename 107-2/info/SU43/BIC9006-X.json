    "description": "Stem cells have the potential to give rise to all tissues. To achieve tissue regeneration and treating human disease requires an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of stem cell biology. In this course, we will discuss how different factors keep multi-potency of stem cells, how they regulate stem cell differentiation and current findings of stem cells in different organisms. The physiological function and potential application of different stem cells will also be addressed. The main goal of this course is to let students understand the basics of stem cell biology and prepare their ability to read research articles and critical thinking.",
