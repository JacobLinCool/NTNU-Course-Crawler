    "description": "This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamental principles of second language acquisition (SLA) research and its implications for language teaching and applied linguistics research. This course addresses second language (L2) development from an interdisciplinary, multi-dimensional approach and the topics covered revolve around studies focusing on the learners' language and development, on internal and external factors affecting SLA, on studies looking at SLA and learner strategies and styles, and finally, on studies relating to L2 learning in naturalistic and instructed settings.",
    "goals": [
        "to provide an introduction to how L2 development have been conceptualized, researched and explained in recent decades",
        "to consider how scholarly as well as popular theories of language learning underlie language education policy, curriculum and materials development, and classroom practices.",
        "to develop critical thinking skills about scholarly inquiry, theories of language learning, language policy and our own pedagogical or research practices."
