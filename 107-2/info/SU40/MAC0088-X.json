The lecture notes on this course (see \\[Men18\\]) will be available and continued.\n\nThe core of the course Real Analysis II shall consist of the following topics treated in accordance with \\[Fed69\\]:\n\n1.  Lebesgue integration: integrals over subsets, Lebesgue spaces, composition and image measures, Jensen’s inequality.\n2.  Linear functionals: lattices of functions, Daniell integrals, linear functionals on Lebesgue spaces, Riesz’s representation theorem.\n3.  Product measures: Fubini’s theorem, Lebesgue measure.\n\nApart of this core, the necessary preparations from topology (locally compact Hausdorff spaces and Tychonoff’s theorem) and functional analysis (Hahn-Banach theorem and Banach-Alaoglu theorem) will be provided following \\[Kel75\\] and \\[DS58\\], respectively. If time permits, Riesz’s representation theorem shall also be put in the context of the theory of locally convex spaces following \\[Bou87\\].  \n[PDF file of this course description including references](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=4d31ed784f334dd3a813eba92955bb84&fno=187565df98c8488da1229e0b1c7fd3d8)",
