    "description": "This course is designed to provide an overview of translation studies as an academic discipline and investigate the issues that translation studies is concerned. It is predominantly theoretical, though examples from actual translation practice will be used. The primary aim of this course is not to produce competent practicing translators. But it is hoped that the theory will help students to be more critical of being a translator and understanding the task of translation.",
