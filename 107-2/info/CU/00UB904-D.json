The course focuses on two novels, _Sense and Sensibility_ (1811) by Jane Austen and _Brooklyn_ (2009) by the Irish author Colm Tóibín.  \n\nThe themes that bind this course together include the following: social class, nationality, sexuality, friendship, and ethical choices.\n\n**Texts**\n\nStudents will need to acquire the Oxford Bookworms (adapted text) version of _Sense and Sensibility_ and the Penguin edition of _Brooklyn_.\n\n**Typical lesson structure**     \n\nStudent presentations (see Grading)\n\nTeacher’s lecture and class discussion of literary text; close reading\n\nViewing of film/TV adaptations of text(s)\n\n**Grading**\n\n**Presentation (20%).** Each student will give one presentation, which should last no longer than 4 mins. The presentation will provide a summary, interpretative analysis and vocabulary guide for a section of a novel. The presentation must include at least three images.\n\n**Midterm and final (40% each).** The midterm and final exams will be split into two sections. The first section (50%) requires students to explain the contextual meaning of a short passage from the relevant novel. In the second section (50%), students have to write a medium-length essay showing their understanding and offering their interpretations of the relevant novel.\n\nPlagiarism will not be tolerated: document every source you make use of in your work.\n\n **Schedule** (may be slightly changed to fit in with Taiwanese holidays)\n\n_Sense and Sensibility_\n\n1.  Intro/Historical background\n\n2.  Chapters 1 and 2\n\n3.  Chapters 3 and 4\n\n4.  Chapters 5 and 6\n\n5.  Chapters 7 and 8\n\n6.  Chapters 9 and 10\n\n7.  Synthesis\n\n8.  Midterm\n\n_Brooklyn_\n\n9_._   Historical background\n\n10_._ Part One\n\n11\\.
