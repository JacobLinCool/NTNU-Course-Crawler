They will also have made a **comprehension and discussion worksheet** on the material to be followed by **an activity or a game**.\n\n**2)** Secondly, over the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a major **task-based project**, in which task groups, of no more than 4 students per group, are asked to **prepare an experiment in an area or topic** that are **of interest to them**, and then **present their work** to the class **via film or live performance**.\n\n**3)** Thirdly, over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a **writing workshop**, in which students are asked to **investigate and write about areas and topics** that have been taught throughout the course\n\n**4)** Furthermore, students should **compile a portfolio in their notebooks** outlining all the English-language experiences they have had during the semester.
