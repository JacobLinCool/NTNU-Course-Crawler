Students will be expected to prepare the homework before coming to class.  This will enable us to have meaningful discussions and other activities.\n\n1.  Please bear in mind that General English 3 is a required course.  Therefore, please come to class on time.  Being frequently late to class will affect your grade.  Also, and very importantly, more than three unexcused absences will put your grade in danger.  So please come to class.  We will try to make the course meaningful and enjoyable.  **In order to get an excused absence, use NTNU’s computer system to apply for a** **請假單** **.**\n\n**Text****:**  _Four Perfect Pebbles: A True Story of the Holocaust_, by Lila Perl and Marion Blumenthal Lazan.  This will be delivered and available to buy in class in Week 4, so students don’t need to go out to a bookstore to buy it.\n\n  \n \n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Content**\n\n1\n\n2/18\n\nIntro to the course and _Four Perfect Pebbles_  (abbreviated as _FPP_)\n\n**(3/3: last day to drop courses; 3/4: last day to add courses)**\n\n2\n\n2/25\n\nCommon errors in English\n\nAn overview of the Holocaust\n\n3\n\n3/4\n\nIn the news\n\nA word game; a song\n\n4\n\n3/11\n\nBuy the book in class and become familiar with it\n\nStudents’ introductions\n\n5\n\n3/18\n\n_FPP_: Prologue and Chapters 1 and 2 (handout #1)\n\n6\n\n3/25\n\n_FPP_: Chapter 3 (handout #2)\n\n7\n\n4/1\n\n_FPP_: Chapter 4 (handout #3)\n\n8\n\n4/8\n\n_FPP_: Chapter 5 (handout #4)\n\n9\n\n4/15\n\n**Midterm test**\n\n10\n\n4/22\n\nReview the test\n\n11\n\n4/29\n\n_FPP_: Chapters 6 and 7 (handout #5)\n\n12\n\n5/6\n\n_FPP_: Chapters 8 and 9 (handout #6)\n\n13\n\n5/13\n\n_FPP_: Epilogue and Afterword (handout #7)\n\n14\n\n5/20\n\nA review of the book\n\nOther activities, TBA\n\n15\n\n5/27\n\nCommon errors in English\n\nOther activities\n\n16\n\n6/3\n\n**Written assignment due** \n\nA word game; a song\n\n17\n\n6/10\n\nIn the news\n\nA song\n\n18\n\n6/17\n\n**Final test**",
