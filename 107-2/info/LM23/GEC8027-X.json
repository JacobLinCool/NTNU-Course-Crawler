    "description": "Globally there are around 300 million indigenous peoples, consisting of approximately 5000 distinct cultures. They live in every part of the world – ranging from the Arctic Circle to tropical rain forests. It is estimated that indigenous peoples occupy 22% of the world’s surface and live in areas which occupy 80% of the planet’s biodiversity and ecosystems.  The natural environment forms an integral part of many indigenous peoples’ livelihoods, cultures, worldviews, and identities which are essential for their survival. However, many indigenous and local communities are threatened by deforestation, mining, restrictive government policies, and bad consequences of ‘development’. The main aim of this advanced course is to outline the key ideas and theories of political ecology, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), and local natural resource management, and its underlying principles and approaches. This course allows students to appreciate the ecological, spiritual and socio-cultural values, and holistic nature of TEK, and critically analyze current discourses on natural resource conservation from a political ecology perspective. This course will be suitable for students both in human and physical geography, and for students in sustainability and social sciences. We will focus both on indigenous and local communities in Taiwan, but also in other parts of the world.",

        "Understand and critically discuss theories on political ecology, nature conservation and traditional ecological knowledge systems.",

        "Map the different stakeholders and governance regimes involved in nature conservation and rural development from  a political ecology perspective.",
        "Evaluate the sustainability of ‘bottom-up’ nature conservation programs across various geographical contexts."
