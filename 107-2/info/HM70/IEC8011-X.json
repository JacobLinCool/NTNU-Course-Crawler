    "description": "Production planning, the planning of production and manufacturing processes in a company or industry, is a process of discussing and defining features of a product before its development. Production planning ensures materials, equipment and employees are all available to meet production goals for a business. Further, appropriate methods are essential for fulfilling the goal of product planning. The capabilities of product planning are essential for the management of technology majored students. Therefore, this course aims to provide an introduction to the concepts of product planning. Meanwhile, analytic methods are also introduced. The students are expected to skills in marketing opportunity exploration, concept analysis, and product development through lectures and case studies.",
