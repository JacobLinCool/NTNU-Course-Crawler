    "description": "Serving as a bridge between previous ELT coursework and actual, situated teaching, this course is designed to offer students an opportunity to observe, explore, and implement effective teaching ideas. It covers in-class micro-teaching, classroom observation, and practice teaching at a high school. The major activities in the first semester include analysis and discussion of teaching videos, visits to schools located in the Taipei area, and most importantly, in-class micro-teaching. For the micro-teaching, each student is required to write a lesson plan and then teach for 30 minutes, with all his/her classmates as students and observers. The micro-teaching is followed by a discussion session led by the instructor, with an aim to help improve students’ teaching techniques. To prepare students for the micro-teaching and practice teaching as well, a review of lesson planning and an introduction to procedures that may help teacher development are given at the beginning of the first semester. The second semester covers as its main activities visits to schools located outside the Taipei area, classroom observation, and practice teaching in a high school. In addition to work related to the micro-teaching and practice teaching, students are required to write various reports and participate in classroom discussion and evaluation. Outside the class, students need to study the assigned chapters in groups, brainstorm for its implications and write a one-page (or longer) reflection on each chapter.",
