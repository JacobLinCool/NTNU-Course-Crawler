    "description": "This semester we will continue to focus on strengthening your skills in public speaking and presentations, with career-related exercises in self-presentation and job interviews.\n\nIn the first semester, students will learn and practice the fundamental skills of public speaking, including designing and delivering a range of speeches (demonstrative, impromptu, informative, persuasive); controlling nervousness; using resources; and polishing delivery. Students will be required to evaluate classmates’ speeches as well as their own. Once in the semester, students are required to attend a local Toastmasters’ meeting and write a report on the meeting (details on this to be announced).",
