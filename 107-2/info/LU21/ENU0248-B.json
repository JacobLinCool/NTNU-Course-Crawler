    "syllabus": "**Senior English Majors - Discussion - Spring 2019**\n\n**Objectives**:  Learning discussion helps students develop their reasoning and communication skills. It encourages collaborative thinking and attunes students to a multiplicity of viewpoints and perspectives. Above all, discussion can help students gain confidence in their intellectual abilities and learn how to evaluate a theory or synthesize ideas. During this course, as well as learning some essential argumentative discourse skills, students will learn the purpose of discussion, the roles of discussants, and the ways of planning, participating in and evaluating different types of discussion. The various reading materials are presented through a very brief lecture from the instructor followed by a variety of student group workshops.
