    "description": "The goals of “Literature in Action” are as followed:\n1. To introduce reflective practice and develop critical thinking; \n2. To engage with and experience a variety of literature and literary activities;\n3 To foster an enthusiasm for literature and provide an insight into the benefits of literacy engagement outside of academia.\n\n“Literature in Action: Storytelling and Its Applications” is designed to explore the art of oral storytelling and its applications to practical daily communication. Storytelling is not only telling stories for entertainment, but a powerful way to get one's ideas across, and at the same time, to elicit constructive responses from the target audience. Students will be provided with a variety of oral storytelling techniques, with the assistance of virtual technology to effectively engage, inform, entertain, persuade, and educate the target audience, and to process the constructive responses for more effective communication.",

        "Understand the ways to effectively apply storytelling to their daily communication.",
        "Choose appropriate virtual media as a delivery option for story-based presentation."
