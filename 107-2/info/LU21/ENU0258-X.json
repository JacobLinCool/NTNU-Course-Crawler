    "description": "The course introduces students to a wide range of literary genres, from different geographical areas and historical periods. It is meant to develop skills necessary to read, understand, critically analyze, and (hopefully!) enjoy literary texts. We will learn what to look for while reading fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, and graphic narratives. We will use techniques of literary analysis, apply literary studies terminology, and demonstrate an ability to move from descriptive observations about literary texts to larger claims about their meaning, context, and significance. We will also cultivate the ability to put our own ideas into writing and into conversation with others.\n\nAt the same time, we will also examine the roles literature has played in individuals’ lives and in society, with a focus on the function of literary works in the 20th and 21st centuries. Questions such as Why is literature produced? Why do we read literature? What effects can literary works have on our lives and contemporary society? will provide the larger framework for our discussion.",
