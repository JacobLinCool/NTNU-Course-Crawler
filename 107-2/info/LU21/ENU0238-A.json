    "description": "This two-semester course is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. In the first semester, students are expected to acquire the fundamentals of English paragraph-writing, including structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), outline, organization and coherence. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. In addition, this course aims to equip students with analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, definition, and classification.",

Since writing is both personal and social, students should learn how to write for a variety of purposes and audiences. Classes rely heavily on a workshop format. Instruction emphasizes the connection between writing, reading, and critical thinking. Students should give thoughtful responses to the readings through well-versed writings. Both reading and writing are the subject of class discussions and workshops, and students are expected to be active participants of the classroom community. Students will have many opportunities to share their work with others. We will examine individuals’ writing processes and pay particular attention to paragraph practice. Altogether 4 pieces of composition are to be fulfilled this semester.\n\n**Course Schedule**\n\n**_2019_**\n\n2/22                 General Introduction\n\nOscar Wilde: His Life and Work\n\nRead and Discuss Oscar Wilde’s “The Selfish Giant”\n\n“The Happy Prince,” “The Nightingale and the Rose”\n\nMovie Screening:\n\n_Wilde_ (1997) directed by Brian Gilbert\n\n**3/1                 _228 Peace Memorial Day     No Class Meeting_ (****調整放假****)**\n\n3/8                   Movie Screening:\n\n_Wilde_ (1997) directed by Brian Gilbert\n\n**Movie Discussion**: Plot, Cast, Production, Soundtrack, Reception\n\n(Response & Accolades)\n\n3/15                 Discuss a Character in a story: Ex. 18, pp. 103-104\n\n                        Summarize a plot: Ex. 17, pp. 101-103\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Narration pp. 94-95\n\n                        Read and Discuss Oscar Wilde’s “The Happy Prince,”\n\n“The Nightingale and the Rose,” “The Selfish Giant”\n\n3/22                 Discuss a Character in a story: Ex. 18, pp. 103-104\n\n                        Summarize a plot: Ex. 17, pp. 101-103\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Narration pp. 94-95\n\n                        Read and Discuss Oscar Wilde’s “The Happy Prince,”\n\n“The Nightingale and the Rose,” “The Selfish Giant”\n\n**First Assignment: Discuss a Character in a story or Summarize a plot**\n\n3/29                 **First Assignment Due**\n\n_Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 4\n\n_Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 5\n\nDefine and Discuss a significant word or term; Ex. 14, pp. 94-97,\n\nEx. 40 (pp. 211-212), Ex. 35 (pp. 198-99).\n\n                        Read Judy Syfers’ “Why I Want a Wife”\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 10 Definition, pp. 146-54;\n\n**4/5                   _Spring Holidays: No Class Meeting_**\n\n4/12                 Define and Discuss a significant word or term; Ex. 14, pp. 94-97,\n\nEx. 40 (pp. 211-212), Ex. 35 (pp. 198-99).\n\n                        Read Judy Syfers’ “Why I Want a Wife”\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 10 Definition, pp. 146-54;\n\n_Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 5\n\n**Second Assignment: Define and Discuss a Significant word or term**\n\n4/19                 **Second Assignment Due**\n\nArgumentation; Ex. 19 & 20, pp. 105-109, Ex. 34 (pp. 196-97), Ex. 36\n\n(pp. 200-202)\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 12 Argument, pp. 167-183\n\nRead Andrew Marvell’s “To His Coy Mistress”\n\n4/26                 Argumentation; Ex. 19 & 20, pp. 105-109, Ex. 34 (pp. 196-97), Ex. 36\n\n(pp. 200-202)\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 12 Argument, pp. 167-183\n\nRead Andrew Marvell’s “To His Coy Mistress”\n\n5/3                   Argumentation; Ex. 19 & 20, pp. 105-109, Ex. 34 (pp. 196-97), Ex. 36\n\n(pp. 200-202)\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 12 Argument, pp. 167-183\n\nRead Andrew Marvell’s “To His Coy Mistress”\n\nJack Ma’s Interview at Davos Economic Forum\n\n**Third Assignment: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Learning English in the Classroom**\n\n5/10                 **Third Assignment Due**\n\n_Paragraph Practice_ Making a Comparison; Ex. 15 & 16, pp. 97-101\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 9 Comparison and Contrast pp. 133-38\n\n“The Passionate Shepherd to His Love” by Christopher Marlowe (1599)\n\n“The Nymph’s Reply to the Shepherd” by Sir Walter Raleigh (1600) \n\n5/17                 _Paragraph Practice_ Making a Comparison; Ex. 15 & 16, pp. 97-101\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 9 Comparison and Contrast pp. 133-38\n\n“The Passionate Shepherd to His Love” by Christopher Marlowe (1599)\n\n“The Nymph’s Reply to the Shepherd” by Sir Walter Raleigh (1600) \n\n5/24                 _Paragraph Practice_ Making a Comparison; Ex. 15 & 16, pp. 97-101\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 9 Comparison and Contrast pp. 133-38\n\n“The Passionate Shepherd to His Love” by Christopher Marlowe (1599)\n\n“The Nymph’s Reply to the Shepherd” by Sir Walter Raleigh (1600) \n\n**Fourth Assignment: Compare and Contrast NTNU English Department and NTU DFFL**\n\n5/31                 **Fourth Assignment Due**\n\nMy biggest problem in university p. 64 & Ex.13 p.94\n\n**6/7**                   **_Dragon Boat Festival    No Class Meeting_**\n\n6/14                 Class Review\n\n**Course Requirements**\n\n1.
