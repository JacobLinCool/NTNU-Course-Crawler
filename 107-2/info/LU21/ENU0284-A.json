    "description": "This course is designed to cultivate students’ listening skills on natural and real-life English, from a variety of sources like TV news, radio broadcasts, and simulated daily conversations. The course materials mainly comprise a series of videos that provides students with the training of listening skills on public speeches in authentic TV news programs. The course also adopts supplementary materials focusing on less formal English in order to familiarize students with the language spoken in various settings. Students will be encouraged to pay close attention to the native speaker’s intonation and accent, diction and content, and to take notes of the addresses or conversations before they engage in class discussion.",
