    "description": "The space between the stars in a galaxy is not empty space. There exists\ngas in ionic, atomic, and molecular form, dust, and cosmic rays. \nIn astronomy, they are called the interstellar medium (or ISM).\nStudying about ISM is important because\nof its role between stellar and galactic scales: Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, molecular clouds, and  return the matter and energy  into the ISM through planetary nebulae, stellar winds, and supernovae. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps us to determine the life of stars,\nand galaxies.",
