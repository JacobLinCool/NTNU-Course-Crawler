In recent years, researches on watermarking/data hiding have been very active in multimedia application. In this course, we focus on the theoretical understanding, computer implementation and hand-on practice of the state-of-the-art anti-counterfeiting technologies, especially for security printing and digital hologram.  \n  \nPrerequisite: Digital image processing or equivalent course required. Programming skill is recommended.  \n  \n  \nII. Tentative Syllabus:  \n  \n1\\. Introduction to anti-counterfeiting technology  \n2\\. Digital halftoning and watermarking  \n3\\. Holography  \n4\\. Dot matrix hologram  \n5\\. Optical document security  \n6\\. Security papers and special effects  \n7\\. Historical development of security printing  \n8\\. Security printing techniques  \n9\\. Noniridescent optically variable devices (OVD)  \n10\\. Iridescent optically variable devices  \n11\\. Value-added design  \n12\\. Project Presentation  \n  \n  \nClass Rules and Procedures:  \n  \n1\\. All students must submit HW sets on the due day. No late HW will be accepted. HW counts 30% of your course performance. Both loaner and copier of HW will receive zero credit. Group discussion is permitted and recommended.  \n  \n2\\. Email is the best way for you to contact the Prof. Wang or the TA.
