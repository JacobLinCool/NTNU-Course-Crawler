    "description": "Stratigraphy is the study of rocks to determine the order and timing of events in Earth history. \n- G. Nichols, 1999 -\n\nWith the acceptance of a reliable time scale, geology will have gained an invaluable key to further discovery. In every branch of science its mission will be to unify and correlate, and with its help a fresh light will be thrown on the more fascinating problems of the Earth and its Past.\n- Arthur Holmes, 1913, The Age of the Earth -\n\nIn this class, we will examine the latest theories in sedimentology and stratigraphy, and their applications to determine the Earth history and mineral economics.",
