    "description": "The Earth is unique amongst the terrestrial planets of the Solar System because it contains water, diverse ecosystems and ancient, evolved continental crust. The continental crust of Earth is composed of various proportions of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks but has an overall silicic composition. The formation of continental crust is not fully understood but is related to the presence of water and plate tectonics. Continents and supercontinents have formed since the Late Proterozoic and continue to present day. The amalgamation and dispersion of supercontinents is well documented since the formation of Pangaea but older and possibly larger supercontinents were formed during the Precambrian. This course will focus on the processes which have produced continental crust and how ancient continents and supercontinents evolved since the Archean.",
    "goals": [
        "To familiarize the students with growth of continental crust.",
        "To introduce to the students the formation and dispersion of continents.",
        "To demonstrate the show the students the relationship between various continental blocks since the Archean."
