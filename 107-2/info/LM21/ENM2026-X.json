    "syllabus": "Discourse Analysis: Spring 2019\n\nInstructor: Miao-Hsia Chang\n\n**Course Objective:**\n\nThe analysis of discourse is the analysis of language in use. Discourse analysis attempts to study the organization of language above the sentence or above the clause, and therefore to study larger linguistic units, such as conversational exchanges or written texts. Discussion in class focuses both on basic ideas in discourse analysis (e.g. Cohesion/coherence and conversation structure) and current trends in discourse analysis, including corpus and discourse analysis, emergent view of discourse analysis, discourse and syntax, multimodal analysis, and genre and register in discourse analysis.\n\n  \n**Schedule**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Readings**\n\n2/19\n\nIntroduction\n\n2/26\n\n**\\*What is discourse analysis?**\n\n3/5\n\n**Cohesion, Coherence and Information Structure**\n\n3/12\n\nMoon festival.
