    "description": "The purpose of the course is to introduce graduate students to some of the most important recent poetry in English. The focus this semester is mainly on poetry that was produced after World War Two, though the course begins with an introduction to important developments from earlier in the twentieth century. Poets from England, Wales, Scotland, (Northern) Ireland, Australia, America, Canada, Saint Lucia, and West Germany are featured on the course. \n\nThemes include:\n\tDevelopments in idiom and form \n\tTraditions and counter-reactions \n\t“Mainstream” vs. “innovative” poetries (in this version of the course there will be more emphasis on the former)\n\tCosmopolitanism\n\tCultural authority and post-imperial conditions\n\tSatire and political critique\n\tNew secular myths\n\tEcological poetry and new pastorals\n\tThe public and private functions of the poet (and what lies in between, including collaboration)\n\tSexualities\n\tPoetics and mental health",
