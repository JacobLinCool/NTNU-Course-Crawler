Special attention will be paid to ESL/EFL education policies. This course aims to approach second/foreign language education policy from a trans-disciplinary perspective. To build theoretical and conceptual grounds for this course, theories and methodological approaches drawn from related disciplines and fields (e.g., language policy and education policy) will be introduced first. We will then turn to research on English education policies within and beyond Taiwan and discuss issues central in ESL/EFL education policy.",

    "syllabus": "**General Course Description**\n\nLanguage education policy is a flourishing field of study. This course focuses on second/foreign language education policies, especially ESL/EFL education policies, which usually exerts great influence on ESL/EFL instruction at schools. We will approach second/foreign language education policy from a transdisciplinary perspective. To build theoretical and conceptual grounds for this course, theories and methodological approaches drawn from related disciplines and fields (e.g., language policy and education policy) will be introduced first. We will then turn to research on English education policies within and beyond Taiwan.\n\n**Requirements & Grading**\n\nThe class will be conducted in a seminar format. Under this format, students are expected to thoroughly read the course materials, share their understanding of the materials with the class, and lead discussion on readings they are assigned to report. Students are also encouraged to bring their own interests to the class and share articles or documents related to this course. Most importantly, each student is expected to draw on the theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches outlined in this course to propose a study on an English education policy. To ensure timely completion of the task, you will give a brief account of the policy you plan to investigate at the 10th meeting. The proposal should contain at least the following elements: (1) research background (i.e., an overview explaining the background of the problem to be researched on and relevant literature or theoretical frameworks); (2) purpose of the study (a statement of the research problem, its importance, and what to be achieved through the study) and research questions, if appropriate; and (3) research design. Final course grades will be determined as follows:\n\n1\\. Presentations of course readings (40%)\n\n2\\. Oral presentation of a research proposal (20%)\n\n3\\. A written version of the research proposal (30%)\n\n4\\. Attendance and participation (10%)\n\n**Tentative Course Schedule**\n\n**Session**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Topic**\n\n1\n\n2/20\n\n**Introduction**\n\n2\n\n2/27\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n3\n\n3/06\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n4\n\n3/13\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n5\n\n3/20\n\nTheoretical Perspectives in Language Policy\n\n6\n\n3/27\n\nLanguage Policy and Political Issues in Education\n\n7\n\n4/03\n\n**No Class (Spring Break)**\n\n8\n\n4/10\n\nLanguage Policy and Political Issues in Education\n\n9\n\n4/17\n\nLanguage Policy and Political Issues in Education\n\n**10**\n\n4/24\n\n\\***A** **brief report of the policy your project focuses on**\n\n11\n\n5/01\n\nInvestigating Language Education Policy\n\n12\n\n5/08\n\nInvestigating Language Education Policy\n\n13\n\n5/15\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n14\n\n5/22\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n15\n\n5/29\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n16\n\n6/05\n\nStudies on Second/Foreign Language Education Policy\n\n17\n\n6/12\n\nResearch Proposal Presentations\n\n18\n\n6/19\n\nResearch Proposal Presentations      \n\n6/27\n\n**Paper Due**",
