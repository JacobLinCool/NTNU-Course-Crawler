    "description": "The purpose of this course is to help graduate students improve their research writing in English and gain basic understanding about conducting empirical research. The class will first introduce the language used in research writing, followed by the different sections (Introduction-Method-Result-Discussion) commonly seen in an empirical research paper. Students are expected to actively participate in class discussion. \n     The class is designed based on the premise of a constructivist approach. Students are expected to learn by actual doing, actively exploring and constructing their understanding and knowledge. Students preview all the materials before every class and join discussions in class. The class also aims at fostering collaboration. Based on these, lectures are cut down to minimum. Each student will be evaluated by their progress made in the class.",
