In a final written report, a “problem” will be identified and defined as the topic of the literature review. Then, the professional literature related to the topic, both theoretical and empirical, will be explored, explained and evaluated. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is needed for elaborating how the literature addresses the topic. A minimum of ten professional citations (from a variety of sources) should be included."
