    "description": "People in different cultures tend to perceive and conceptualize the world differently. What are these differences? Are they random or systematic? Can language as part of culture explain some of these differences? What is the relationship between language and mind (or thought)? What other factors can explain how and what people think the way they do? This course invites you to delve into these fascinating issues and gain some understanding of how thoughts vary with culture and language. This course expects the students to (1) achieve an understanding and awareness of how thoughts in different cultures can vary; (2) achieve an understanding of how our thoughts might be shaped by our culture and language; (3) be able to give several examples of how culture and language shape thoughts; and (4) be able to recognize, respect, and reconcile different cultures and cultural dilemma.",
