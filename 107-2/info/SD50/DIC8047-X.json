    "description": "It is hard to understand an ecosystem without understanding the metabolism of microorganisms living there. The main aim of this course to lead students to know the background knowledge of microbial diversity and the relevant research fields, including the phylogenetic and functional diversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, metagenomics, microbial physiology and metabolism, biogeochemistry, and oceanography. The techniques and approaches related to microbial ecology have been significantly advanced in the past decade; thus, the relevant tools will be introduced in the course. Moreover, the oral presentation and discussion of students will be the important parts in this course that will facilitate students to have more understanding of microbial diversity.",
