It develops an understanding of the important theoretical developments that took place in the discipline from the Renaissance to the present. Prominent art historians and their theories are commented through the reading of exemplary texts. Their reception and influence  are analysed and contextualized. Changing methods of interpretation are carefully examined and compared through the scope of a selection of texts that cover different hermeneutic approaches and perspectives.",
