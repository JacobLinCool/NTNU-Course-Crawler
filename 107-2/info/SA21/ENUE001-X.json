    "syllabus": "**Course description**\n----------------------\n\n### This is an introductory course that aims to help students become familiar with current theories and practices in EFL teaching and learning. Students will be exposed to common approaches and practices in EFL through reading articles and undertaking hands-on projects. While students are oriented to English teaching methods and techniques, they will engage in analyzing and creating reading materials according to visual representation (VR) theories, and they will also learn to identify teaching principles in action through observing a particular in-service English teacher’s teaching. This course ultimately intends to enable students to apply teaching concepts and principles to their future teaching practices. \n\n**Textbook:** \n--------------\n\n### Brown, H. D, & Lee, H.
