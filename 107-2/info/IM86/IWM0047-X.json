This course focuses on managing employee compensation in contemporary organizations. Topics that will be particularly emphasized include: application of compensation principles to achieve organizational objectives; strategic use of compensation systems for attracting, motivating, and retaining employees; and managerial aspects of paying employees at all organizational levels.

It will be taught using a combination of lectures, discussions, and experiential exercises/applications to offer students an opportunity to develop competencies in compensation management.",
