    "description": "This course covers (a) the Standard Mode (SM) of particle physics as well as new physics with elementary particles and fundamental interactions beyond the SM, and (b) parton model for proton-proton collisions to test the Standard Model and to search for new physics at hadron colliders. In addition, we will introduce tools such as MadGraph and skills such as root analysis to search for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future colliders.",
