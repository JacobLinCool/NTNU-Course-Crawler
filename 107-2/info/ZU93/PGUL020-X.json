    "description": "This course explores various manners in which the Europeans have historically imagined and conceptualized otherness. With a focus on such aspects as ‘wonder,’ ‘otherness’ or ‘Orientalism,’ this course takes students from classical Greece to contemporary times and discusses both unbridled fascination (sinophilia) and radical rejection (racial theories) in Europeans’ perceptions about themselves and others.",
