    "syllabus": "This course aims to enhance students’ research capability through the critical evaluation of research papers and reports. It engages students in the critique of a range of research papers which adopt different research approaches underpinned by different theoretical perspectives and use different research designs and methodologies for data collection and analysis. This course will be taught by two professors as well as guest speakers who will take turns to guide students in the evaluation process, to share their own experience of conducting research, and to critique their samples of own published work. Students will have opportunities to present their own research ideas and obtain feedback in class. Each student will be required to write a proposal for their research project at the end of the course.\n\n**Tentative schedule**\n\n1.  9/8  Course Introduction\n2.  9/15  Reading and Literacy\n3.  9.22  Reading and Literacy\n4.  9/29  Reading and Literacy\n5.  10/6  Reading and Literacy\n6.  10/13 Classroom Discourse\n7.  10/20 Classroom Discourse\n8.  10/27 Classroom Discourse\n9.  11/3  Classroom Discourse\n10.  11/10 Language Anxiety\n11.  11/17 Language Anxiety\n12.  11/24 Language Anxiety\n13.  12/1 Bilingual Education\n14.  12/8 Bilingual Education\n15.  12/15 Project presentation\n16.  12/22 Project Presentation",
