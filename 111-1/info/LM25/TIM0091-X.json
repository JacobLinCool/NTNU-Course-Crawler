    "description": "Translation Studies, notably the Descriptive School, is an offshoot of comparative literature. This course traces the development of translation studies in relation to the translation of literary, cultural and general texts. Weekly classes will involve readings on a range of topics focusing on the concept of equivalence in literary translation, untranslatability and linguistic/cultural issues related to translation. Students will be required to read select articles and make short written and/or oral presentations on a weekly basis. The course requires at least one day of commitment to complete the assigned weekly reading.",
    "goals": [
        "Gaining a comprehensive under- standing of issues relevant to contemporary translation studies.",
        "Understanding how these issues and theories apply in an academic research setting in a way that will help develop students’ critical thinking and enhance journal article or graduate thesis writing."
