    "description": "An important component of translation studies involves the history of translation: how various cultures spread to other recipient cultures through translation. And one of the best ways to study this history is to trace the development of Latin: how the Romans absorbed Greek culture, how, in the Latin west, the Roman Catholic Church propagated itself through the Latin translation of the Bible, how the Latin philosophical vocabulary was passed down into the western culture tradition, and so on. The aim of this course is to provide students with a gateway into Latin. We will study Latin grammar and syntax, and also translate various Latin sentences into idiomatic modern Chinese. In the process, students will find that their understanding of western languages has improved considerably. They will also acquire a deeper understanding of etymology and syntax. \n\nPh.D. students are expected to do more work than the MA students.",
