Course Description\n\nThis course is designed to study European literary works that have been influential in connection with three interlocking cultural images: the food, the fashion, and the city. If Eurocentricism is one of the main factors that have constituted European cultures, the image of food represents the somatic jouissance of the power manipulation over the others, and the image of fashion manifests the spiritual identity of the inner other. The city, built and inhabited by denizens, however, seems to be a site of absolute otherness, forever resistant to be subsumed by cosmopolitanism. Writers from 9 countries will be discussed revolving around the three images throughout the semester. \n\nII. Required Texts\n\nA course pack will be prepared by the instructor.\n\nIII.
