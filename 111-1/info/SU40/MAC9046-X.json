    "syllabus": "This course would like to attract students who are interested in mathematical models and their applications to various mathematical models of infectious diseases. The mathematical models provide approaches to studying how mathematical concepts could help us in investigating the spread of infectious pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria) through dynamic populations. There are three main objectives:\n\n(1) Basic principles of mathematical models in infectious disease epidemiology\n\n(2) Mathematics and methods required for studying these mathematical models in epidemiology.\n\n(3) Applying mathematical models to existing data as little projects/experiments (e.g., math. models vs. growth of HIV, Covid-19 infectious population respectively). \n\nSchedule and Topics\n\nWeeks 1-10:\n\nPart I. Basic Concepts of Mathematical Epidemiology\n\n1.  Introduction to Mathematical Epidemiology\n2.  Simple Compartmental Models for Disease Transmission\n3.  Endemic Disease Models\n4.  Epidemic Models\n5.  Models with Heterogeneous Mixing\n6.  Models for Diseases Transmitted by Vectors\n7.  Discussions of Exercises and Reports\n\nWeeks 11-14 :\n\nPart II. Models for Specific Diseases\n\n1.  Models for Tuberculosis.\n2.  Models for HIV/AIDS\n3.  Discussions of Exercises and Reports\n\nWeeks 15-16: Project Studies (in Working Groups) and Reports of Topics.\n\nWeeks 17-18: Students study online materials and discuss",
