    "syllabus": "**Description**\n\nStudents who had taken biogeography and/or conservation biology courses at undergraduate level are familiar with the essences of classic theories or golden cases, but not necessarily track the context precisely. This course is to encourage students to examine the original research papers, and to seek in-depth knowledge in biogeography. Through a weekly journal club-style discussion led by the instructor, guest speakers, and peers, the course is designed not only to enhance the students’ specialised knowledge in biogeography, but also to help the students accustom themselves reading and analysing research papers critically - even with the classic ones.\n\nAs how it was in Fall 2020, the SBNC course for 2022 will also be held in an informal, seminar-like forum format. However, in this year we will spend most of the time reading and discussing a number of classic texts selected from 'Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries,' which was edited by the renowned biogeographer Mark Lomolino and his colleagues.\n\nPrior knowledge in biogeography, ecology, and/or evolutionary biology is highly recommended but not required for taking this course.\n\nThis is an EMI course. All participants are anticipated to actively express their thoughts with spoken and written English.\n\n**Course Structure**\n\nThe course will be taught in forum-style, being held once a week for 16 weeks. Each course session will usually consist of a brief introduction by the host-of-the-day, followed by an extensive group discussion session with no obvious break in between. All students should attend all sessions and engage attentively in the discussion.\n\n**Prerequisite** None\n\n**Language**         English\n\n**Class Size**         Ideal class size would be <20 postgraduate students\n\n**Credit System**\n\nNo formal exams for the course. Credits will be evaluated through the regularity of attendance, levels of engagement in the discussion, and the quality of final paper.\n\n*   weekly assignment & feedback (25%)\n*   attendance & engagement in discussion (35%)\n*   final paper (40%)\n\nLeave and make-up: No late assignment turn in. No skip is allowed throughout the course. For unforeseeable incidents including traffic disruption or serious personal issues, the student should consult with the instructor within one week after the incident and provide relevant evidences or creditable proofs.\n\n**Weekly Seminar Topics (provisional)**\n\nWeek 1            9/05             Introduction, icebreaker\n\nWeek 2            9/12             Early Classics in Biogeography\n\nWeek 3            9/19             Guest Talk\n\nWeek 4            9/26            Earth History, Vicariance, and Dispersal\n\nWeek 5            10/03           Species Ranges\n\nWeek 6            10/10           (Public holiday)\n\nWeek 7            10/17          Guest Talk\n\nWeek 8 (M)    10/24        (No class; final paper prep.)\n\nWeek 9            10/31          Revolutions in Historical Biogeography\n\nWeek 10          11/07         Diversification\n\nWeek 11         11/14         Guest Talk\n\nWeek 12          11/21          The Importance of Islands\n\nWeek 13          11/28         Assembly Rules\n\nWeek 14          12/05         Gradients in Species Diversity\n\nWeek 15         12/12        Guest Talk\n\nWeek 16 (F)    12/19        (No class; final paper due)\n\n  \n[教學進度與主題附件](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=5c397aada0534217ab69e3704f5efbbb&fno=2591f309a1ea4018abf9f59ede5fd7b8)",
