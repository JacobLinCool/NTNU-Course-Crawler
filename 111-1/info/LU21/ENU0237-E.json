    "syllabus": "**Course description:**\n\nThis two-semester course is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. Specifically, it aims to (1) familiarize students with the fundamentals of paragraph structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), (2) equip them with organizing skills to maximize the effectiveness of writing from paragraphs to short-essays, and (3) improve language skills for concise expressions of ideas. In the first semester, students are expected to review important topics of English paragraph-writing. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. The course also develops students’ analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, definition, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, and classification. \n\n**Class Policies:**\n\n1\\. In this semester, students are expected to complete three writing assignments on three different modes—description, narration and process. Each assignment includes a draft and a revision. The expected length of each writing assignment is one paragraph of around 200-300 words. \n\n2\\. Students are expected to attend each class—attendance will be taken. Three unexcused absences will result in an automatic failing grade. Students arriving in class later than 15 minutes will be deemed absence for that meeting. Each absence will result in deduction of 4 out of 20 from your attendance grade. \n\n3\\. Students who miss class are responsible for content. Any student who misses a class has the responsibility for obtaining copies of notes, handouts, assignments, etc. \n\n4\\. All typed assignments completed outside of class must be 1.5-spaced with 12 font size.\n\n5\\. Written assignments must be handed in on time. \n\n6\\. Cell phones can only be used for dictionary consultation during class time.  \n\n7\\. Academic honesty is expected at all times. Plagiarism will result in a serious grade penalty and may lead to an automatic failing grade.\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Content**\n\n**Notes**\n\n1\n\n0924\n\n**Introduction & Ch 1**\n\n2\n\n1001\n\nCh 2 \n\n3\n\n1008\n\nCh 2 (1st assignment: All about me)\n\n4\n\n1015\n\nCh 3 (1st assignment due)\n\n5\n\n1022\n\nCh 3\n\n6\n\n1029\n\nCh 4 (1st revision due)\n\n7\n\n1105\n\nCh 4\n\n8\n\n1112\n\n**Midterm** **Exam**\n\n9\n\n1119\n\nCh 5 (2nd assignment: My summer break before college)\n\n10\n\n1126\n\nCh 5 (2nd assignment due)\n\n11\n\n1203\n\nCh 6 (Description)\n\n12\n\n1210\n\n**Sports** **Day**\n\n13\n\n1217\n\nCh 6 (Narration) (2nd revision due); 3rd assignment: How to…?\n\n14\n\n1224\n\nCh 6 (Process) (3rd assignment due)\n\n15\n\n1231\n\nReview\n\n16\n\n0107\n\n**Final Exam (3rd revision due)**\n\n17\n\n0114\n\nIndividual writing conference\n\n18\n\n0121\n\nIndividual writing conference",
