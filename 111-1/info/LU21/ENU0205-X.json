    "syllabus": "**Course description**\n\nAs more than 70 percent of the total vocabulary of English is borrowed, “the more we know about the sources and processes of linguistic borrowing, the better our chances of coping with technical vocabulary and general usage” (Stockwell & Minkova 2001). In this course, students will expand their vocabulary through a conscientious study of Latin and Greek roots in English (incl. associated terms covered in the thematic focus). The course will also examine the linguistic changes accompanying word formation.\n\n**Required text**\n\nHandouts & supplementary materials will be distributed in class.\n\n**Course requirements**\n\nMidterm (25%), Final (30%)\n\nClass participation, incl. presentations (20%)\n\nHomework assignments (25%)\n\n**Course schedule (16 + 2)**\n\nWeek 1-- Course overview and preliminaries\n\nWeek 2 & 3-- Roots Set I; Linguistic ancestry\n\nWeek 4 & 5-- Roots Set II; Thematic focus: Medicine\n\nWeek 6 & 7-- Roots Set III; Thematic focus: Science\n\nWeek 8-- Presentations\n\nWeek 9-- Midterm\n\nWeek 10 & 11-- Roots Set IV; Thematic focus: Economics\n\nWeek 12 & 13-- Roots Set V; Thematic focus: Arts & Music\n\nWeek 14-- Roots Set VI; Thematic focus: TBA\n\nWeek 15-- Presentations\n\nWeek 16-- Final\n\n\\*Flexible session-- Moodle assignments",
