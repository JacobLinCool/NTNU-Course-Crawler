    "syllabus": "**Course Description**\n\nIn this course students learn the basic skills of doing research in literature and cultural studies: read cinematic, literary and critical texts, find research topics, gather reference materials, learn appropriate reference style, and write papers. A central theme of research will be chosen every time this course is offered. 5 literary/cinematic texts related to this theme will be proposed/chosen at the first meeting to be the primary texts for collaborative research in this semester.\n\nIn addition to learning the basic idea of research, the first half of the semester will be devoted to the reading/viewing/analysis of the 5 primary texts. After that, students will be introduced to library catalogues and databases, find and read secondary references to gain further understanding of the primary texts as well as their research topics. In preparation to write their papers, students will also learn the basic MLA reference style, practice the skills of citation and documentation, build a reference list and read sample papers. All these efforts will lead up to the completion of a short paper (5-7 pages) at the end of the semester.\n\n**Tentative Schedule (For Fall 2020; the Fall 2022 detailed schedule TBA)**\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nContents\n\n1\n\n9/16\n\nOrientation\n\n2\n\n9/23\n\n1.  “Thinking in Print” and “Connecting with Your Reader” in _The Craft of Research_ 9-20\n2.
