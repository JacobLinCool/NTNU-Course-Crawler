    "syllabus": "教學目標\n\nThis course will give an overview of the major features of English grammar. It will **not** cover **all** grammatical features in English, but rather aim at initiating independent thinking and research on the **problematic** areas of English grammar. You will become familiar with the intricacies of English grammar, particularly those that tend to be challenging to nonnative speakers. In this course you will learn to describe how English sentences are constructed and you will develop the skills necessary to analyze and explain English words, phrases and sentences, as well as learn the terminology to talk about them. In addition, you will also learn how to use the rhetorical patterns in writing for the purpose of clarity and effectiveness. \n\n教材大綱（含每週教學主題）\n\nWeek 1 Adjusted Holiday (No class)\n\nWeek 2 Orientation\n\nWeek 3-5  Tense/aspect\n\nWeek 6-7  Passives\n\nWeek 8 Mid-term\n\nWeek 9 Rhetorical skills\n\nWeek 10 Sports Day (No class)\n\nWeek 11-12 Conditional clauses\n\nWeek 13-14 Relative clauses\n\nWeek 15 Wrap-up and question discussion\n\nWeek 16  Final exam",
