Course Description:**\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help students improve their pronunciation of the English language as they speak it. With a brief introduction to the nature of English consonant and vowel production, as well as the peculiar characteristics of the supra-segmental features of the language, the course provides students with various kinds of listening and speaking practice. Special focus of the oral/aural practice will be placed on pairs/groups of potentially confusing sounds, linking of sounds across syllable/word boundaries, stress, intonation, rhythm, etc. In addition to classroom drills, 2 recording assignments will be given. It is hoped that through the intensive drills students may develop their sound awareness, become conscious of their pronunciation problems and further adopt the most efficient way to solve the problems and improve their pronunciation.\n\n**II.
