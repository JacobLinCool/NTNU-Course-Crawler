    "syllabus": "**Course Description and Objectives:**\n\nThis yearlong survey course aims to broaden students’ knowledge and to form a working outline of English literary history, with the second semester covering from the Renaissance to the early 18th Century. The reading mainly focuses on the canonical authors who represent important literary and cultural concerns of their time, and the assignments span genres including romance, epic, ballad, poetry, drama, critical essay and film. Perspectives from historical contexts and literary/critical theory would be brought into the reading as a vehicle for further delving into the core significance of the literary works.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1.  Grading policy: ¨Attendance & participation 10%  ¨Group presentation 20%  ¨Exams 70%\n2.  Punctuality in coming to the class and turning in your homework is strongly desired. Exceptions are allowed only under emergent circumstances or notification in advance.\n3.  Students will hand in their homework only in electronic text on Moodle. No late homework would be accepted.\n4.  Any student who plagiarizes or edits writing of others without acknowledgement would fail the course.\n\n**1st Semester Schedule**\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Contents**\n\n1\n\n09/17\n\nOrientation: course overview; **Introduction to the Old English Period**\n\n2 (Vol. 1)\n\n09/24\n\n_Beowulf_ (37-59, 89-109), esp. ll.1-129, 164-169, 194-209, 406-455, 506-510, 572-577, 612-618, 691-735, 817-835, 1255-1278, 1383-1389, 1477-1483, 1644-1650, 2207-2216, 2510-2515, 2584-2668, 2705-2714, 2743-2751, 2799-2808, 3033-3037, 3137-3160, 3173-3182\n\n3\n\n10/01\n\n_Moon Festival, no class._\n\n4\n\n10/08\n\n_Beowulf_ continued.\n\n5\n\n10/15\n\n**Introduction to the Middle English Period**\n\n_Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ (pp. 201-256, ll. 1-490, 1476-1557, 2259-2530.)\n\n6\n\n10/22\n\n_Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_ continued\n\n7 (handouts)\n\n10/29\n\nChaucer: \"General Prologue\", (256-261)\n\n8\n\n11/05\n\n\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\" (handouts)\n\n9\n\n11/12\n\n**§** **Wrap-up discussion**\n\n10\\*\n\n11/19\n\n**Midterm**\n\n11\n\n11/26\n\n_Morte Darthur_ (534-554)\n\n13\n\n12/03\n\nEveryman (558-580)\n\n13(Vol. 2)\n\n12/10\n\n**Introduction to the Renaissance Period,** _Uto__pia_ (75-85, 96-99, 106-117)\n\n14\n\n12/17\n\n_Dr. Faustus_ (658-659, 679-717)\n\n15\n\n12/24\n\n_Faustus_ continued.\n\n16\n\n12/31\n\n_Faustus_ continued.\n\n17\n\n01/07\n\n**§** **Wrap-up discussion**\n\n18\\*\n\n01/14\n\n**Final**",
