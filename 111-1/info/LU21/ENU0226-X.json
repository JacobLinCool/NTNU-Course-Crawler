    "syllabus": "    American Literature  \nDepartment of English, NTNU, Fall 2022\n\nCourse description  \nThe course offers and overview of and introduces students to canonical American literary voices, from the early beginnings to the beginning of the 20th century. This historical period covers roughly the Puritan period, the Enlightenment, American Renaissance and the modern era. We will explore how a variety of writers responded to, imagined, and in a sense created what is seen as the “American” experience. The lectures and class discussions will consider the historical, cultural and political movements that contextualize these voices as well as the literary history that informs their work. While we will cover some historical background to contextualize the texts we explore, the focus will be on the textual analysis and discussion of the case studies.\n\nObjectives\n\n**_Objectives_**\n\nThe main goals of the lectures are the following:\n\n1.  To understand the development and major themes of American literature.\n2.  To give a critical reading of a representative set of classic fictional and poetic works and a comparative study of the cultural milieu of each work.\n3.  To draw the connections and differences between authors, styles, and thematic concerns.\n\n**_Textbooks_**\n\n1.  _The Norton Anthology of American Literature_. Shorter Ninth edition. Ed. Robert S. Levine. New York: Norton, 2017 (Bookman)\n2.  Lecture notes, handouts, film clips or any extra materials posted on Moodle [http://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/](http://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/)\n\nCourse requirements  \nStudents are expected to be familiar the required readings prior to the class discussion. Students will be graded on the basis of active participation in the class discussions, reports on moodle (30%). Midterm test 30%, final test 40%. Failure to take the mid and final test, to attend the classes, take quizzes and posts on moodle (ten reports on moodle and four responses to colleagues’ posts) will result in the student’s inability to pass the exam. The posts on moodle should be around 200 words in length and could range from your thoughts on the assigned readings, the answer to the study guides posted by the instructor or a close reading of a certain paragraph.\n\nAcademic Dishonesty  \nAcademic dishonesty is defined as but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, misrepresenting one’s work, and forging documentation. Academic dishonesty is a serious matter. I am savvy and vigilant in detecting students who use unattributed sources in their reports on moodle, citing references without indicating the sources or “collaborate” with fellow students during exams. Any student who plagiarizes or cheats will fail the course.\n\n**1**\n\n*   Christopher Columbus, “Letter of Discovery,” “Letter to Ferdinand and Isabella,” 45-51.
