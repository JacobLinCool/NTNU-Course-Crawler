    "syllabus": "**I. COURSE OVERVIEW**\n\nThe main purpose of this course is to further enhance students’ abilities to read, reflect and then write critically about different types of texts. Students will be exposed to reading materials and writing samples and are encouraged to apply what they have learned in the previous writing classes to produce various types of short essays with your insight and perspective.\n\n**II. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES**\n\nWe only learn to be a better writer by actually writing. Therefore, students are expected to **read** assigned material prior to the class, **attend** class on time, **participate** in class discussions, and most importantly **complete** writing assignments.\n\n**1) Attendance**\n\n          Weekly attendance is required. If you have to miss a class for some reason, please email me in advance.  **If more than two** **unexcused** **absences occur, the final grade will be deducted by 5 points**. Students will likely fail this course if more than 4 unexcused absences occur.\n\n**2) Essays and project**\n\nStudents will write two essays and one interview project, and then revise them after receiving the instructor’s feedback. All writings must be typed (double spaced, Times New Roman, font size 12). The length of the assignments can vary.\n\nFor the interview project, we will collaborate with ViewFinder (視角) to produce feature articles published online. Students will learn how to develop interview questions, how to take a photograph, how to write a report, and how to design the project layout. This collaboration with the mass media will offer on-the-job training and internship opportunities to enrolled students.\n\n**\\[Assignment Policy\\]: Late submission will not be graded and will be assigned a score of** **0**.\n\n**3) Class activities**\n\n          After writing each draft essay, students will present their work in class via different class activities. The format and content of the class activities will be announced one week in advance. The purpose of the class activities is to help you find out the strength and weakness of your essays. Students will gain feedback from the peer, in addition to the instructor. After the class activities, students will revise and submit revised essays within a week. \n\n**4)** **Writing workshops**\n\n          Two writing workshops are scheduled, one for the mid-term and one for final. In these workshops, students write in class after a session of discussion with peers.  **No make-up workshops under any circumstances.**\n\n**III.
