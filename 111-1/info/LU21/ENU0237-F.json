Since writing is both personal and social, students should learn how to write for a variety of purposes and audiences. Classes rely heavily on a workshop format. Instruction emphasizes the connection between writing, reading, and critical thinking. Students should give thoughtful responses to the readings through well-versed writings. Both reading and writing are the subject of class discussions and workshops, and students are expected to be active participants of the classroom community. Students will have many opportunities to share their work with others. We will examine individuals’ writing processes and pay particular attention to paragraph practice. Altogether 4 pieces of composition are to be fulfilled this semester.\n\n**Meeting Schedule**\n\n**_2019_**\n\n**9/13  National Holiday; No Class Meeting**\n\n**9/20**  Course Introduction\n\n**9/27**  _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n      All About Me: introduce yourself and write a short paragraph about yourself\n\n      **First Assignment: All About Me**\n\n**10/04**   **First Assignment Due:** **All About Me**\n\n       _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n       _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 1: An Introduction to Writing\n\n**10/05**   _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n       _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 1: An Introduction to Writing\n\n**10/11   National Holiday; No Class Meeting**\n\n**10/18**    Describe a Face or a Person: _Paragraph Practice_ Ex. 3, Ex. 28, Ex. 31\n\n        _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 2: The Writing Process\n\n        **Second Assignment: My Face**\n\n**10/25**    **Second Assignment Due: My Face**\n\n        _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 2\n\n        _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 2: The Writing Process\n\n**11/01**    Describe a Space or a Place: _Paragraph Practice_ Ex. 4, p. 65, Ex. 38\n\n         Read Mark Twain’s “Boyhood Remembered”\n\n         _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 3:\n\n         Four Steps for writing, Four Bases for Revising\n\n        **Third Assignment: Describe a Space or a Place**\n\n**11/08**     **Viewing Ishiguro’s _The Remains of the Day_**\n\n**11/15**     **_University Athletic Day: No Class Meeting_**\n\n**11/22     Third Assignment Due: Describe a Space or a Place**\n\n         **Movie Discussion**:  \n\n          Plot, Cast, Production, Soundtrack, Reception (Response & Accolades)\n\n          Describe a Picture: _Paragraph Practice_ Ex. 6, Ex. 29\n\n         **Fourth Assignment:**\n\n         **Describe Van Gogh’s Painting _The Langlois Bridge at Arles_**\n\n**11/29     Fourth Assignment Due: Describe Van Gogh’s**\n\n         **Painting _The Langlois Bridge at Arles_**\n\n          _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 4\n\n          _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 4: Exemplification\n\n**12/06**     Explain How to do or make something: p. 65, p. 79. p. 80\n\n_Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 7: Process\n\n**12/13**           _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 5\n\n          **Fifth Assignment: Explain How to do or make something**\n\n**12/20             Fifth Assignment Due: Explain How to do or make something**\n\n           My biggest problem in university p. 64 & Ex. 13 p.94\n\n**12/27**            Class Review\n\n**_2020_**\n\n**1/3             End of Semester Party**\n\n**Course Requirements**\n\n1.
