We will read a wide gamut of literary works that will enable us to look critically at such complex issues and themes as the components and practices of feminism, _carpe diem_, love-hate relationship, and sacrifice. Other than selected dramatic works such as Eve Ensler’s _Vagina Monologues_ and William Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_, we will also read poems that have a bearing on the theme of _carpe diem_ and Oscar Wilde’s short stories that have an obsessed focus on sacrifice. We will study all these texts intensely through close reading within class and practice viewing a text through the prism of different critical approaches or frameworks. This course is suitable for beginning students and should serve as preparation for further study in either dramatic literature, poetry, and novels. Lively discussion, debate, and differences of opinion will be crucial to our class meetings.\n\n**Course Schedule**\n===================\n\n**_2018_**\n\n**Week One (2/28)**           **228 Peace Memorial Day; No Class Meeting**\n\n**Drama**\n\nWeek Two (3/7)              General Introduction\n\nWeek Three (3/14)         Eve Ensler’s _Vagina Monologues_\n\nWeek Four (3/21)         Eve Ensler’s _Vagina Monologues_\n\nWeek Five (3/28)            Eve Ensler’s _Vagina Monologues_\n\n**Week Six (4/4)               Children’s Day; No Class Meeting**\n\nWeek Seven (4/11)         Eve Ensler’s _Vagina Monologues_\n\n                                        **Mid-Term Essay Due:** My Monologues; **Performance Day**\n\nWeek Eight (4/18)          William Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_\n\nWeek Nine (4/25)           William Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_\n\nWeek Ten (5/2)               William Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_\n\nWeek Eleven (5/9)          William Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_\n\nWeek Twelve (5/16)       William Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_ \n\n                                        **Quiz &** **Performance Day**\n\n**Poetry**\n\nWeek Thirteen (5/23)     “The Passionate Shepherd to His Love” \n\nby Christopher Marlowe (1599)\n\n“The Nymph’s Reply to the Shepherd” \n\nby Sir Walter Raleigh (1600) \n\n“To His Coy Mistress” by Andrew Marvell\n\n**Fiction**\n\nWeek Fourteen (5/30)     Read and Discuss Oscar Wilde’s “The Happy Prince,”\n\n“The Nightingale and the Rose,” “The Selfish Giant”\n\nWeek Fifteen (6/6)         Movie Screening: _Wilde_ directed by Brian Gilbert\n\nWeek Sixteen (6/13)       Read and Discuss Oscar Wilde’s “The Happy Prince,”\n\n“The Nightingale and the Rose,” “The Selfish Giant”\n\nMovie Discussion: Plot, Cast, Production, Soundtrack, Reception\n\nWeek Seventeen (6/20)  **Performance Day**\n\n**Week Eighteen (6/27)   Term Paper Due**\n\n**Course Requirements and Evaluations**\n\n1.
