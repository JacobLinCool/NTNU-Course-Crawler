    "syllabus": "**The Objectives**: The goal of this course is to enhance students’ English-speaking competence by **broadening their scope** of English conversation and **enhancing their communication skills in real-life situations**. At the same time, it will try to **build confidence** and **motivate** them to **actively participate in English conversation**. In order to do so, there is a **five-pronged approach** to the course this semester:\n\n1.  Firstly, the **course textbook** presents natural language in authentic contexts, and helps **develop conversation management strategies** in order to significantly improve both fluency and confidence.\n2.  Secondly, there will be various **supplementary materials**. These will vary over a range of areas and at appropriate times, so that students can to familiarize themselves with topical language spoken in various popular settings.\n3.  Thirdly, over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake a **task-based project**, in which task groups, of no more than 4 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are **of interest to them**, and then **present their work** to the class **via film or performance**. Examples include short films (comedy, drama, horror), radio shows (news, weather, interviews, ads), plays (skits, drama, musicals) or shows (music, magic, games).\n4.  Fourthly, over the course of the second-half of the semester, students will undertake a second **task-based project**, in which task groups are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are of interest to them, and then **present their work** to the class via **a conversational PowerPoint presentation.**\n5.  **Finally, autonomous learning.** Students should **practice speaking** **English** outside every chance they get. Indeed, all major English-language encounters **should be recorded for** **grading**.\n\n**N.B. All five elements** **will be assessed** when calculating the final grade.\n\n**The Course Schedule**\n\n**Wk.**\n\n**Date**\n\n**Content**\n\n**Notes**\n\n1\n\nIntroductions, Orientation, Warm-up\n\n2\n\n1.
