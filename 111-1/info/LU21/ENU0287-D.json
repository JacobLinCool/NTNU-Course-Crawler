    "syllabus": "**Overview:**  \nThis writing course aims to guide students to (1) practice basic academic writing conventions, (2) sharpen their analytical essay writing skills, (3) enhance essay coherence and cohesion, and (4) improve accuracy and concision in language use.  \nThe course will familiarise students with proper academic language and conventions to compose short essays on modes of writing such as argumentation, definition, causal analysis, process analysis, and comparison and contrast.  \nIn addition to the different analytical modes of writing, the course will introduce students to organising and editing strategies to fine-tune their essay writing. Students will learn how to apply principles of coherence and cohesion to maintain consistent claims and to offer logical transitions. Additionally, students will learn how to improve their accuracy and concision in language use by avoiding common sentence errors and improving concision and specificity in word choice and sentence formation.\n\n**Schedule:**  \nRefer to the attached document for a tentative schedule.\n\n**Class Activities:**  \nLecturing / Presentations / Group and Class Discussions / Writing\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAttendance: 10%  \nAssignments: 70%  \nActive involvement in discussions and debates: 20%\n\n**Course Material:**  \nThere is no set textbook for this course.\n\n  \n[教學進度與主題附件](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=3eeb86ebc205474a9841c0659111492d&fno=86b1a28cda5c4ff2a92aea7a5570b71b)",
