Specifically, it aims to (1) familiarize students with the fundamentals of paragraph structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), (2) equip them with organizing skills to maximize the effectiveness of writing from paragraphs to short-essays, and (3) improve language skills for concise expressions of ideas. In the first semester, students are expected to review important topics of English paragraph-writing. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. The course also develops students’ analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, definition, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, and classification.\n\n**Textbook:**\n\nLangan, J.
