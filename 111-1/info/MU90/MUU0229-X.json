    "description": "The music of the Beatles will form nearly all of the semester’s repertoire, with a few brief examples from other popular music performers. The Beatles have been chosen because of their longevity, popularity, and the quality of their songs. Over less than a ten-year period, they developed as songwriters and inventive studio artists in a way unsurpassed in the history of popular music.\nTwo to three Beatles songs per class period will be highlighted. Historical film footage and movie clips will also be introduced to demonstrate the social impact of the Beatles.",
