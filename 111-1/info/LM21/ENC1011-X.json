Plagiarism is defined as “presenting, as one’s own, the work or the opinion of someone else.” Plagiarism is “copying material of some sort, either word for word or sense for sense”; ideas, conclusions, and ways of organizing material can also be plagiarized. Students are guilty of plagiarism when the words, sentences, ideas, conclusions, examples, and/or organization of an assignment are borrowed from a source (a book, an article, online sources, another student’s paper, etc.) without correctly acknowledging the source. If you have any question at all about how to cite sources, check first with the instructor or another faculty member or the MLA Handbook. UPDATE: New department policy is to require major papers to be uploaded into Turn It In, to check for plagiarism._",
