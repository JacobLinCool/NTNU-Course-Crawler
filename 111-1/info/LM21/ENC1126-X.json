    "syllabus": "“The Unendurable is the Beginning of the Curve of Joy”: \n\nLove in Literature and Culture\n\nNational Taiwan Normal University, Fall 2022\n\nWednesdays, 9:20-12:10\n\nDr. Justin Prystash                                                 \n\nOffice:     Cheng 720                     \n\nOffice Hours: W 15:20-17:10; F 11:20-13:10; Virtual Meetings by Appointment\n\nEmail: jsprystash@gmail.com               \n\n**Course Description**\n\nThis course seeks to investigate the seemingly ordinary yet elusive concept of love through a wide range of texts and media. After using Ronald de Sousa’s _Love: A Very Short Introduction_ to provide a brief panoramic overview of different approaches to the topic, we will read, watch, and listen to philosophy, poetry, novels, film, and music (mostly from the Romantic period forward) to see how love has been conceptualized and expressed. We will cover many gradients of love, from metaphysical love—the idealist conception of love as a fundamental structuring principle of the universe, a basic element of reality itself—down to passion and sexuality, the more fleshy, carnal, embodied aspects of love. We will consider both heterosexual love and non-normative, queer expressions of love and sexuality. We will find that love, to borrow Tennyson’s language, draws us “like a sinking star / Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.”          \n\n**Texts**\n\nStudents should purchase the following texts, made available at _Bookman_ in Taipei (across from NTU); all others will be supplied by the professor.\n\nRonald de Sousa, _Love: A Very Short Introduction_ (Oxford UP)\n\nEmily Brontë, _Wuthering Heights_ (Penguin)\n\nDjuna Barnes, _Nightwood_ (Faber & Faber)\n\nIris Murdoch, _The Bell_ (Vintage)\n\n**Assignments**\n\nAttendance/Participation   20%\n\nSeminar Paper (10+ pages) 80% \n\n**Attendance/Participation**\n\nThis is a graduate seminar. Seminars are not meant to be lecture-based, but discussion-based. That means you need to participate in order for us to have a successful seminar (it also means that I need to regularly fade away from the center of the class). Although I will guide our discussions, I expect you to come to class familiar with that week’s assigned reading(s), ready to ask questions and have fruitful discussions and debates. I will take attendance every week. I will also regularly hold in-class group “games” where you will analyze and/or synthesize passages from our texts and share your perspectives with the class. \n\n          \n**Seminar Paper**\n\nThis is the usual assignment given at the end of a graduate seminar: an academic essay, similar in style and organization to published essays that appear in academic journals. They must focus on one of the texts we read this semester, they cannot be used in any other seminar, and they cannot be plagiarized.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nWeek 1, 9/7: Introduction, Syllabus Review\n\nWeek 2, 9/14: Ronald de Sousa, _Love: A Very Short Introduction_\n\nWeek 3, 9/21: Plato, _Symposium_ and “The Allegory of the Cave”\n\nWeek 4, 9/28: From Frederick C.
