    "syllabus": "**English III: Literature and Culture**\n\n_“What is important now is to recover our senses. We must learn to see more, to hear more, to feel more. Our task is not to find the maximum amount of content in a work of art. Much less to squeeze more content out of the work than is already there. Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all. The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art – and, by analogy, our own experience – more, rather than les, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than show what it means. In place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.”_\n\n*   from “Beyond Interpretation” by Susan Sontag\n\n**Objectives****:** This course is designed to provide students to **introduce** students to **acclaimed Anglophone literature** from all around the world. The overall aim is to become **more critical readers in English** by **analysing several texts** and **learning some essential literary terms and devices**. At the same time, we will **delve into the cultures** that we meet along the way in an effort to **better understand the readings and authors** we encounter. A major focus will be on **improving student fluency** in expressing ideas **both orally and in written forms in English**.\n\nHence, there will be a three-pronged approach to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** this is **a flip class.** There will be **five short readings** which students **must read** for homework before they come to class. Each of these readings will be analysed and discussed in the following class. The various readings will be examined closely and provide a historical snapshot of Western literature.\n\n**2) Secondly,** you will be asked to join a **book club group**, in which you will be asked to **read and analyse a classic novel** and **give a presentation** on it at the end of the course.\n\n**3) Finally**, students will be asked to **write** **a book review**, **a movie review** and **a critical essay,** the latter based on the readings done in class.\n\n**N.B. All elements to the course will be assessed for the final grade**\n\n**Course Schedule:** This is a tentative schedule and may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion. \n\nWk\n\nDate\n\nContent\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n   Introduction and Orientation\n-------------------------------\n\n**Choose a kid’s book**\n\n2\n\n1.
