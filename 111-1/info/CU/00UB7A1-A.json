    "syllabus": "**Objectives****:** This course is designed to support college freshmen in their use of **English language in an academic context** and to improve their **reading proficiency and vocabulary knowledge** through intensive and extensive reading and reading skill/strategy training. In addition, this class also aims to build up students’ proficiency in the other **three main language skills**—**writing, listening, and speaking**—through activities that integrate the four language skills. The objectives of this class include (1) developing students’ **effective English reading skills**, (2) **improving their fluency** in expressing ideas **in oral and written forms in English**, and (3) introducing **autonomous self-study skills** for their future learning. Therefore, there will be a five-pronged approach to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** the **course textbook and online practice website** emphasize **vocabulary learning and building**. There is also a purposefully structured skills and strategies program to **propel language learning** and **create independent learners**. Furthermore, the textbook helps improve reading proficiency and **develop practical critical thinking.**\n\n**2) Secondly,** over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake **one major task-based project**, in which task groups, of no more than 4 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics that are of interest to them**, and then **present their work to the class** via film, audio, or performance. Examples include short films (comedy, drama, horror), radio shows (news, weather, interviews, ads), plays (skits, drama, musicals), and shows (music, magic, games).\n\n**3) Thirdly,** students will need to do at least **_10 hours_ of** **autonomous learning** in total this semester, and these experiences must be proven for grading.\n\n**4) Finally**, there will be a **writing workshop** after which students will be asked to write **a short critical essay** based on class work.\n\n**N.B:** All elements to the course will be evaluated and assessed for the final grade.\n\n**Schedule:** This is a tentative schedule and may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion.\n\nWk\n\nContent\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n   Introduction, Orientation, Cards\n\nBring a book next class!\n\n2\n\n1.

You are expected to do at least _10 hours_ in total this semester. Alternatively, you can **record autonomous work in your notebooks for grading.**\n8.  **Grades will be downgraded** for failure to attend class without reason, excessive lateness, lack of participation or failure to do homework or assignments on time.\n\n**Grading Policy****: The Business!**\n\nFinal grades are based and assessed on performance in the following:\n\n**1)** Attendance and Participation: 10%\n\n**2)** Task Project: 20% (Presentation: 10%, drafts and reflection: 10%)\n\n**3)** Midterm Quiz: 10%\n\n**4)** Book/Movie reviews & critical essays: 20%\n\n**5)** Online learning/auto-learning: 20%\n\n**6)** Final Exam: 20%",
