During the lectures, we will introduce the maker movement, IoT technology, and the concept of participatory urban sensing. There will be plenty of hand-on activities in the class, and this grading of this course will be based on the projects.  \nIt is recommended (but not a must) that students bring their own laptops to the class activities, and it is expected that students carry out their own projects at the end of his course. All the IoT platforms and sensors will be prepared by the lecturer and distributed in the course. Basic programming and quick self-learning (by reading Internet documents) skills are required for taking this course.  \nIf you are not sure whether you have met the prerequisite of the course, please contact the instructor directly.  \nTextbook:\n\nThere are no textbooks in this course, but you are expected to read MANY technical articles on the Internet as the project goes. Please do feel free to contact the instructors if you have any questions about this course (and the projects).  \nRecommended  \nInternet of Things: A Hands-On Approach, Arshdeep Bahga and Vijay Madisetti, Vijay Madisetti.  \nDesigning the Internet of Things, Adrian McEwen and Hakim Cassimally, Wiley.  \nGrading:\n\nThere are no exams in this couse, and the grading of this course will be mainly based on the class participation and projects. The specific scoring percentage of each project is:  \nParticipation: 10%  \nIn-class assignments: 30%  \nProject Checkpoints: 20%  \nTerm Project: 40%\n\n  \nSchedules: \n\n1\\.   IoT Introduction\n\n2\\.   IoT Development Platform\n\n3\\.   IoT Sensing Layer and its common interfaces (I2C, SPI, UART, Digital, Analog)\n\n4\\.   IoT Networking Layer and its common protocols (BLE, WiFi, LoRa)\n\n5\\.   IoT Application Layer and its common transmission protocols (MQTT)\n\n6\\.   IoT Backend: Cloud Services (e.g., ThingSpeak and IBM Bluemix)\n\n7\\.   IoT Backend: Data Analysis (R)\n\n8\\.   IoT Backend: Data Visualization (e.g., D3.js, Highcharts, Leaflet)\n\n9 ~ 16.  IoT Projects",
