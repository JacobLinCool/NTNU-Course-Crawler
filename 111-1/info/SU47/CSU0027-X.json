    "description": "Systems software consists of the programs that transform the raw hardware of a computer system into an environment suitable for creating and running application programs. The most important systems program is the operating system. Other systems software includes assemblers, linkers, loaders, and compilers. This course is a detailed examination of how systems software is created on top of the hardware. Concepts are illustrated using a simple (and imaginary) computer.",
