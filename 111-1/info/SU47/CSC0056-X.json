    "syllabus": "This course is offered in English (EMI), with Mandarin support. 此課程為 EMI 英語授課 (佐以中文輔助).\n\nData communication is essential for networked computing systems. The objectives of this course are for students to learn design principles in data communication, to get some ideas of networking systems analysis, and to have some hands-on experience in systems development.\n\nThis course is structured as a hybrid course (數位課程) on [Taiwan Online Campus](https://toc.co.ntnu.edu.tw/). The lectures are divided into three categories: asynchronous online (learn at your own pace), synchronous online (real-time remote class), and traditional face-to-face (physical lectures in classroom). See the course schedule below for detail. Most of the course materials will be posted on [Moodle](https://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/).\n\n**Prerequisites:**  \nThe students should have some working knowledge in both C and Linux. We will study the codebase of [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and will learn how to trace and modify an open source implementation at such a scale.\n\nCourse Schedule\n\n#\n\nDate\n\nTopic\n\n1\n\nSep 5\n\nCourse Introduction\n\n2\n\nAsync.\n\nBroker-Based Data Communication\n\n3\n\nSep 19\n\nMessaging Broker Design and Implementation\n\n4\n\nSep 26\n\nThe Queueing Model\n\n5\n\nAsync.\n\nPoisson Process and Markov Chain\n\n6\n\nAsync.\n\nQueueing Systems\n\n7\n\nAsync.\n\nCase Study: The Aloha System\n\n8\n\nOct 24\n\n**Midterm Exam**\n\n9\n\nOct 31\n\nData Communication Bus\n\n10\n\nAsync.\n\nData Routing and Flow Control\n\n11\n\nAsync.\n\nTDMA Data Communication\n\n12\n\nNov 21\n\nTime Synchronization\n\n13\n\nNov 28\n\nCommunication Error Handling\n\n14\n\nAsync.\n\nCase Study: LoRa and LoRaWAN\n\n15\n\nDec 12\n\nResearch Topic: Real-Time Fault-Tolerant Communication\n\n16\n\nDec 19\n\n**Final Exam**\n\nFor more information, see [https://web.ntnu.edu.tw/~cw/csc0056/](https://web.ntnu.edu.tw/~cw/csc0056/)  \nFor historical data, see [https://web.ntnu.edu.tw/~cw/shares/courses/csc0056/](https://web.ntnu.edu.tw/~cw/shares/courses/csc0056/)",
