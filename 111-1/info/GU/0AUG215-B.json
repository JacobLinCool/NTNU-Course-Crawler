    "syllabus": "This semester, we will study the theme of Greek mythology and legends in Western art and literature.  We plan to structure our class around the theme of Greek mythology.  We will organize our lectures, student presentations, group discussions around the thematic exhibition. \n\nUnlike Christian monotheistic traditions, Greek mythology is not based on faith, and is polytheistic.  It reflects system of the ancient Greeks features.  Actually, myths are not just imaginative stories based purely on fiction and with no basis in fact. Rather, they represent a form of universal truth transmitted through ballads and based on the collective memory of a people.  \n  \nA long succession of painters and sculptors over the ages has striven to visualize these narratives, attempting to picture and portray them. The fascinating and ingeniously crafted narratives and images inspired by Greek mythology have continued to inspire many an artist, even down to modern times, such as Pablo Picasso.\n\nWe will discuss ancient images and modern expressions that depict the gods and other stories along with age-old texts that served as their inspiration together for comparison.  We will also read selections of Chinese translations of _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, both traditionally attributed to Homer, Hesiod’s _Theogony_, Virgil and Ovid’s _Metamorphoses_.  \n \n\nA more detailed syllabus will be announced in the class.",
