    "description": "This course discusses the relations between science and societies and the evolution of the movement of scientific literacy in the second half of 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. Firstly, a comparison of cultural differences between the Eastern and Western is focused and then followed by an exploration of the adaptation of Mandarin Chinese society as it encountered science. The phenomenon of ‘two cultures’ and the evolution of philosophy of science are addressed. Finally, the transition from the conception of scientific literacy to the ideas of science literate and multiliteracies is discussed.",
