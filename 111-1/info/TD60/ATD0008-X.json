In the spirit of MOOCS, we require students to read some assigned readings, watch some assigned free online videos, and discuss what they have learned or raise questions in class. Except lecturing and in-class discussions, this course also includes a few fieldtrips, a mid-term oral presentation, a final report on their artwork based on an assigned theme, and a written report on gallery visit(s).\n\n**Grading Policy**:\n\n\\*20%: Class Participation  (e.g. discussion, attendance, presentation, etc.)\n\n\\*30%: Midterm: A 15-20-minute oral presentation\n\n\\*40%: Final: A 20-25-minute oral presentation\n\n\\*10%: A written report on your gallery visit(s)\n\n**A Tentative Syllabus****：**\n\nWeek\n\nDate\n\nTheme\n\nNote\n\n1\n\n \n\nCourse orientation\n\nDistribution of oral presentations and explanation about the assigned theme for your final report\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\nAn overview\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nEdgar Allan Poe “The Man of the Crowd”\n\n\\*The presentation should be based on a critical review of a renowned painter or an art theory; each presentation will be followed by the instructor’s comments and group discussion.\n\n4\n\n \n\nEdgar Allan Poe “The Man of the Crowd”\n\n\\*The presentation should be based on a critical review of a renowned painter or an art theory; each presentation will be followed by the instructor’s comments and group discussion.\n\n5\n\n \n\nCharles Baudelaire (Selected readings)\n\nOral presentation\\*\n\n\\*The presentation should be based on a critical review of a renowned painter or an art theory; each presentation will be followed by the instructor’s comments and group discussion.\n\n6\n\n \n\nCharles Baudelaire (continued.)\n\nDitto.\n\n7\n\n \n\nWalter Benjamin (Selected readings)\n\nDitto.\n\n8\n\n \n\nWalter Benjamin (continued.)\n\nDitto.\n\n9\n\n \n\nMid-term oral presentation\n\nDitto.\n\n10\n\n \n\nMid-term oral presentation\n\nDitto.\n\n11\n\n \n\n_Paris Spleen_ (Selected Poems) (pending)\n\n \n\n12\n\n \n\nMid-term oral presentation\n\nDitto.\n\n13\n\n \n\nFinal report (Theme: pending)\n\n＊You may also compose an artwork in the light of “The Painter of Modern Life.”\n\n\\*Create an artwork based on the assigned theme by offering an explanatory note.\n\nEach report will be followed by the instructor’s comments and group discussion.\n\n14\n\n \n\nFinal report (Theme: pending)\n\nDitto.\n\n15\n\n \n\n_Paris Spleen_ (Selected Poems) (pending)\n\n \n\n16\n\n \n\nFinal report (Theme: pending)\n\nDitto.",
