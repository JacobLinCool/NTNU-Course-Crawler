Specifically, in this semester this course will guide students to think about the roles that music plays in the construction and continuation of societies, cultures, and the environment, especially at a time when we are facing various kinds of crises of the Anthropocene. Through interacting with instructors and guest speakers’ lectures and participating in in-course presentation and discussion sessions, as well as completing mid-term presentation and individual term paper, students will learn how people around the world promote cultural diversity, social justice, and environmental sustainability through musical practices. In addition, the reading materials and weekly discussions will help students develop their skills of critical thinking, public presentation, and academic writing in English.\n\n**Course Grading:**\n\nThis course adopts the following criteria to evaluate students’ performance:\n\n1.  In-class presentations (ICP) (2 times; 10% each): 20%\n2.  In-class responses to Discussion Sessions (DS) (15 times; 3% each): 45%\n3.

Bonus: Students who actively respond to classroom activities may get bonus points (up to 5 points) for their participation.\n\n**NTNU Grade Scale and Conversion Chart:** http://iweb.ntnu.edu.tw/aa/gpaweb/pic/FAQ\\_English%20version.pdf\n\n**Plagiarism**:\n\nStudents are to abide by and subject to all university policies in relation to academic integrity.
