    "description": "This course will discuss on the perspectives of adaptation and selection at the interface of ecology and evolution. In general, Adaptation and selection considers how organisms have evolved to become adapted to their abiotic and biotic environments and how current ecological processes interact with evolutionary process. The field stresses the use of genetic tools in understanding evolutionary and ecological theory. The goal of this course is to understand the adaptive significance and evolutionary potential of phenotypic variation in natural populations. The format of the course will be a combination of lecture and discussion. Instructors will give background lectures, and students will lead discussion sessions on a variety of topics covered each week. Lectures and assigned readings are designed to provide a foundation in adaptation and selection in relation to phenotypic and genetic variation in natural populations.",
