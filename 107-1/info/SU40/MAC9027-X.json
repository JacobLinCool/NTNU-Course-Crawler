    "description": "This course trains perspective high school teachers in problem solving in mathematics. The problems are selected from competition levels, so as to facilitate discussion and thinking on key concepts. Teacher candidates are required to compose test papers, preferably one set for a group in order to promote collaboration and group work. Finally, one groups’ test papers will be criticized by the other groups in lessons. Feedback will be collected and reviewed in order to improve the quality of the work.",
