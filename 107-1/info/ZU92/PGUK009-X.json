    "syllabus": "Overview  \nThis course enables participants to become more effective intercultural communicators.  \n  \nIntercultural communication at its most basic refers to understanding how people from different cultures behave, communicate and perceive the world around them. Understanding this, we are better equipped to avoid conflict and misunderstandings.  \n  \nOver the duration of the course, students will be asked to reflect on how their own culture informs how they think, communicate and behave. Developing an understanding of how their own language and behaviour is informed by cultural values and assumptions will enable them to better understand others.  \n  \nStudents will be introduced to cultural dimensions such as individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, masculinity-femininity, long-term orientation and indulgence versus self-restraint. They will be led to understand how these dimensions inform everyday interactions.  \n  \nStudents are requested to arrive for class with enquiring minds.  \n  \nSchedule  \nA weekly schedule will be arrived at through negotiation and will largely depend on how many students register for the class. However, each student will be required to complete a number of individual assignments and one group presentation.  \n  \nEvaluation  \nActive Participation: 30%  \nGroup Presentation: 20%  \nAssignments: 30%  \nAttendance: 20%  \n  \nNotes  \nAssigned tasks must be done on time. Delays will be penalised.  \nAttendance is required. Being over 30 minutes late is treated as an absence.  \nGrades are not negotiable.  \n  \nCourse Materials  \nThere is no set textbook for this course, although the two books listed below are recommended. Essential materials (written, audio and video) will be provided by the instructor. Students will self-select additional materials as appropriate for completing assigned tasks.",
