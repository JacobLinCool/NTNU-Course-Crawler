    "syllabus": "Course description\n\nThis course aims to develop students’ English proficiency, in particular their listening and speaking competence. Main goals of the course include: (1) to build students’ academic listening skills and life situational listening proficiency, and (2) to develop students’ speaking skills and communication abilities. Through extensive listening practices and multi-media materials, students will learn to employ listening strategies and academic skills for better listening comprehension, and to engage in discussions centered on specific themes. Students are encouraged to take active participations in class works for a maximized learning experience.\n\nCourse requirements\n\n**1\\. Textbook**\n\nTo be announced.\n\n**2\\. Class Participation**\n\nPunctual attendance and participation in class is REQUIRED. This is particularly so since this is a listening/speaking course. You can only learn from interacting with others and actively participating in in-class activities. Thus you are not only required to come to class, but your active participation is required as well. If you prefer to simply sit silently in the class, this will not be the right course for you.\n\n**3\\. Lab Visits**\n\nEvery student must visit and make use of the lab this semester. \n\n**4\\. Group Presentation**\n\nStudents will form small groups and present on a topic of your choice.\n\nFor the presentation, you MUST proceed in English and be on time for the presentation. If you miss your presentation, no make-up presentation is possible.\n\n**5\\. Quizzes and Final Exam**\n\nThere will be around in-class quizzes. The one with the lowest score will be dropped and not taken into calculation. Absence from a class is no excuse for not knowing the assignment/exam. No make-up exam is allowed. Cheating on exams is absolutely forbidden.  \n\nSchedule\n\nWeek 1-3 Chapter1\n\nWeek 4-6 Chapter2\n\nWeek 7-9 Chapter4\n\nWeek 10-12 Chapter5\n\nWeek 13-15 Chapter7\n\nWeek 16-18 Chapter9",
