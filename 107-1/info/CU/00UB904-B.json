Goals:**\n\n本課程希望透過閱讀當代文學作品來探索世界與自我。選出作品都放置在某些主題之下，希望同學們藉由文學作品所開創出的不同文學視角來思考與人的處境相關等各式議題。課程中也將選讀由日文譯成英文的當代作品，希望帶入不同的文化視野。本課程企圖藉由文學與文化議題的討論，希望同學們藉由閱讀英文文學作品，除了培養英文的閱讀能力之外，能夠藉由閱讀發展出一種具有人文與哲理厚度與批判性的思考態度與方法。\n\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with a reasonably compact introduction to   the study of the social, historical, cultural, and personal issues rendered and explored in contemporary literary works. The selected works will be studied in terms of basic aesthetic elements and critical concepts and approaches so as to heighten students’ sensibility of the aesthetic, critical, and ethical dimensions of literary works.
