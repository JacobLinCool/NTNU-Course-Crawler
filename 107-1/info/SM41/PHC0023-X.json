    "description": "Solid state physics is a BIG subject. The more you know about its various topics, the better. Therefore, I'll try to cover as many topics as possible. The elementary topics, such as crystal structure, phonons, band structure, and Fermi surface, should be covered in undergraduate course already. \nConsequently, I'll review them in a concise manner.",
