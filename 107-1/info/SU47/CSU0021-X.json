    "syllabus": " \\*\\*\\* Note that this course requires intensive programming in Javascript, C or C++ (possibly 3,000 to 6,000 lines of code).  \n  \nThis course is about the programming of 3D computer graphics. During the first half of this course, we will focus on the high-level programming of 3D graphics applications using the OpenGL API. Then, during the second half of this course, we will study the whole process of a 3D renderer, which we will implement as a three-part assignment. There is also a final project. If time allows, we will also cover advanced topics such as texture mapping, GPU programming, global illumination ...etc.  \n  \nPart I: Leaning to Drive -- Writing 3D Applications  \n• Overview (1 week)  \n• WebGL & OpenGL Programming (2 weeks)  \n• Transformations (1 week)  \n• Viewing (1 week)  \n• Shading (1 week)  \nPart II: Under the Hood: Implementation of a Renderer  \n• Geometric Processing (1 week)  \n• Hidden Surface Removal (1 week)  \n• Scan Conversion (2 weeks)  \n• Texture Mapping (1 week)  \nPart III: Advanced Topics  \n• GPU Programming, Curves and Surfaces, Animations, Global Illuminations,…etc. (3-4 weeks)",
