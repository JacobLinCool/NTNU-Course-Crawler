    "syllabus": "Instruments based on spectroscopic principles, such as elemental and molecular spectroscopy, and chromatographic theories, including gas and liquid chromatography, are the major contents. Different mass spectrometers that can be used as chromatographic detectors will be discussed in details as well. A portion of this course will encompass capillary electrophoresis, the powerful separation technique that may be used for trace and multi-mode analysis.  \nStudents are required to take notes during the class and finish reading assigned articles from different reference books and journals. No textbook will be specifically assigned for this course. Attendance and participating discussion during class hours will be considered in the final grade decision.",
