    "description": "Many research questions in the field of translation studies are best approached through qualitative research methods. In particular, research focused on insight, understanding, and discovery from the perspectives of those being studied may offer promise of making contribution to the theory and practice of translation. In this class, we are going to explore various research approaches such as interviewing, observations, grounded theory, ethnographic study, and other techniques which are central to qualitative inquiry. Qualitative studies commonly conducted in the area of translation and interpreting will also be discussed. After taking this course, you will be able to understand assumptions and characteristics held by qualitative research; to identify definitions, uses, strengths, and limitations of different types of qualitative methods; as well as to collect, analyze and interpret qualitative data concerning translation activities. Each student is also required to conduct a qualitative study in his or her chosen area of translation and interpretation.",
