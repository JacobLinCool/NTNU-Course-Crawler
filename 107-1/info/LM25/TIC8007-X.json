    "description": "It is often remarked that the most often translated Chinese text is the Dao De Jing of Laozi, with over 250 English translations now in existence. This course will examine some of these translations and consider the history of the translation of the text. We will first examine the various Chinese versions of the text along with some of the major Chinese commentaries. Then we will consider earlier translations by missionaries such as Legge. We will then examine the major scholarly and poetic renditions. Finally we will look at how the Tao De Jing has been manipulated by the New Age Movement to fulfill a spiritual void felt by many in the West.",
