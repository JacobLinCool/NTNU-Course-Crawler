    "description": "The goal of this course is to provide students a basic understanding of processes within the Earth’s climate system and how these processes shape up the observed geographically heterogeneous distribution of climate. We will first review the basic structures of the climate system, such as the surface energy balance, the water cycle, general circulation of the atmosphere and oceans, and its geographic variability. After that, specific efforts will be made to the descriptions of local climate and the underlying physical processes. Knowledge obtained will then be applied to understand potential climatic changes due to human activities, such as global warming, desertification, tropical deforestation.",
