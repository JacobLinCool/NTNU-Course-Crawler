    "description": "This two-semester course is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. In the first semester, students are expected to acquire the fundamentals of English paragraph-writing, including structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), outline, organization and coherence. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. In addition, this course aims to equip students with analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, definition, and classification.",

Since writing is both personal and social, students should learn how to write for a variety of purposes and audiences. Classes rely heavily on a workshop format. Instruction emphasizes the connection between writing, reading, and critical thinking. Students should give thoughtful responses to the readings through well-versed writings. Both reading and writing are the subject of class discussions and workshops, and students are expected to be active participants of the classroom community. Students will have many opportunities to share their work with others. We will examine individuals’ writing processes and pay particular attention to paragraph practice. Altogether 4 pieces of composition are to be fulfilled this semester.\n\n**Meeting Schedule**\n\n**_2018_**\n\n9/14            Course Introduction\n\n9/21            _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n                   All About Me: introduce yourself and write a short paragraph about yourself\n\n                   **First Assignment: All About Me**\n\n9/28            **First Assignment Due:** **All About Me**\n\n                    _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n                    _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 1: An Introduction to Writing\n\n10/5            _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n                    _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 1: An Introduction to Writing\n\n10/12           Describe a Face or a Person: _Paragraph Practice_ Ex. 3, Ex. 28, Ex. 31\n\n                    _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 2: The Writing Process\n\n                    **Second Assignment: My Face**\n\n10/19           **Second Assignment Due: My Face**\n\n                    _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 2\n\n                   _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 2: The Writing Process\n\n10/27           Describe a Space or a Place: _Paragraph Practice_ Ex. 4, p. 65, Ex. 38\n\n                    Read Mark Twain’s “Boyhood Remembered”\n\n                    _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 3: Four Steps for writing, Four Bases for Revising\n\n                    **Third Assignment: Describe a Space or a Place**\n\n11/02           **Third Assignment Due: Describe a Space or a Place**\n\n                    _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 3\n\n                    _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 3: Four Steps for writing, Four Bases for Revising\n\n11/09           _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 4\n\n                     Describe a Picture: _Paragraph Practice_ Ex. 6, Ex. 29\n\n                     _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 4: Exemplification\n\n**11/16**           **_University Athletic Day: No Class Meeting_**\n\n11/24            **Viewing Kurosawa’s _Dreams_**\n\n                     **Fourth Assignment: Describe Van Gogh’s Painting _The Langlois Bridge at Arles_**\n\n11/30            **Fourth Assignment Due: Describe Van Gogh’s Painting _The Langlois Bridge at Arles_**\n\n                     **Movie Discussion**: Plot, Cast, Production, Soundtrack, Reception \n\n12/07            Explain How to do or make something: p. 65, p. 79. p. 80\n\n                      _Paragraph Skills_ Chapter 7: Process\n\n12/14             **Fifth Assignment: Explain How to do or make something**\n\n                      _Paragraph Practice_ Chapter 5\n\n**12/21             Fifth Assignment Due: Explain How to do or make something**\n\n                       My biggest problem in university p. 64 & Ex. 13 p.94\n\n12/28              In-Class Writing\n\n**_2018_**\n\n**01/04             Discussion of the In-Class Writing**\n\n**01/11             Final exam**\n\n**Course Requirements**\n\n1.
