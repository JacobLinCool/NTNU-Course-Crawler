    "description": "As is well-known, syntax is one of the core courses in linguistics. It is the study of sentence structure. The earlier you take this course, the more awareness you’ll develop toward sentence structure. Such sensitivity to sentence structure will make you a keen learner for any language, not only English but also second foreign languages such as French, German, Japanese, etc., or even our native languages, such as Mandarin, Taiwan Southern Min, etc. After taking this course, you will be able to start doing interface studies of syntax with other fields in linguistics like sentence processing, L1 and L2 acquisition. You will also be equipped with the background for pursuing more advanced studies of syntax. \n\nRegarding the course content, this course is an introduction to generative theory, an influential syntactic framework founded by Chomsky, the most cited author alive in the world of academia. This framework is established through the study of central aspects of English grammar and the comparative study of English grammar as well as the grammar of other languages. Using homework problems and in-class exercises, we will construct a model of (a fragment of) English. Coursework emphasizes problem solving skills and syntactic argumentation. Special reference will be given to facts and analyses of Chinese when appropriate. This course will be of great help to students who want to explore a theoretical linguistic field such as syntax. For those students who are not so linguistically-oriented, this course will also be helpful in giving a clear concept of syntactic structure of English and in fact syntactic structure of language in general.",
