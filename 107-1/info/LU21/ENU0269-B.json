    "description": "The goal of the course is three-fold: to elevate students’ confidence and motivation to participate in English conversation, to broaden their knowledge pertaining to English conversation, and to enhance their skills in conducting English conversation. Through adjusting one’s attitude toward his/her role as an English interlocutor and acquiring communication strategies and basic understanding of discourse features of English conversation, students are expected to be able to conduct, i.e., beginning, sustaining, and ending, an English conversation in a culturally appropriate fashion and in a light-hearted manner. The class is conducted primarily through pair or group conversation of class materials and mini exercises to cultivate and polish learners’ conversation management skills.",
