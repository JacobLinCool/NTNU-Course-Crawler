    "description": "1.\t簡介文化差異與文學翻譯理論及技巧之應用\n2.\t講授近體詩結構，格律與傳統。選讀代表詩人作品\n3.\t評論台灣現代詩面貌與特式。作品選讀\n4.\t嘗試近體詩/現代詩創作及英譯\nThis course attempts to view traditional and modern Chinese poetry in a cultural model informed but not dominated by contemporary Western or Continental theories. Students will be asked to ponder the following questions: Can poetry be translated? What are the criteria for good poetry? What is poetry in Chinese now? Lectures will cover such broad topics as translation theories; prosody, structure, and convention of regulated verse; aesthetics of traditional and modern Chinese verses; democratic features of modern poetry from Taiwan; etc. We will analyze, enjoy, critique, and translate samples of both traditional and modern Chinese poetry. I will also ask and help each one of you to produce your own proud samples.",
