    "description": "Serving as a bridge between pre-service ELT coursework and actual, situated teaching, this course is designed to offer students an opportunity to observe, explore, and implement effective teaching ideas. It covers in-class micro-teaching, classroom observation, and practice teaching at the Affiliated High School of NTNU.\nThe major activities in the first semester include introduction to the English curriculum guidelines for Grades 1 to 12 in Taiwan, career planning in EFL teaching profession, school visits, and most importantly, in-class micro-teaching. To prepare students for the micro-teaching, the course also provide a review of lesson planning, and effective techniques in teaching vocabulary, grammar, listening, reading, speaking, and writing. Each student is required to write a lesson plan and then teach for 30 minutes, with all his/her classmates as students and observers. The micro-teaching is followed by a discussion session led by the instructor, with an aim to help improve students’ teaching techniques. \nThe second semester covers the following as the primary activities: talks by experienced senior teachers on various topics, more classroom observations, and a 6-week practice teaching at the Affiliated High School of NTNU. In addition to work related to the micro-teaching and practice teaching, students are required to write various reports and participate in classroom discussion and evaluation.",

Course Description:**\n\nEnglish Teaching Practicum is a hands-on practicum for pre-service English teachers in the English Department. It offers students a valuable opportunity to gain more classroom experience, and to develop and apply their teaching ideas in the real classroom. In the first semester, students will learn about the recent English curriculum guidelines in Taiwan as well as useful strategies for teaching English skills/subskills to middle school students on different proficiency levels. They will also learn to write well-structured lesson plans and to improve their own teaching skills by observing and appreciating other teachers’ teaching. Classroom activities mainly include lectures, invited talks, micro-teaching and group work. Students will also visit middle schools for classroom observations.\n\n    In the second semester, several experienced English teachers will be invited to give a talk to share their teaching experience and discuss essential ELT issues in Taiwan. Apart from lectures, invited talks, group work and other in-class activities, students will also have classroom observations and a 6-week practice teaching at the Affiliated High School of NTNU.\n\n![*](file:///C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)  **Delivery of Instruction:**\n\n1.         Lecture\n\n2.         Group work & discussion\n\n3.         Student presentation\n\n4.         Micro-teaching/practice teaching\n\n5.         Classroom observation\n\n![*](file:///C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)  **Grading Policy:**\n\n1\\.

After the micro-teaching session, the instructor will lead a discussion session to help the teaching group improve their ELT knowledge and skills.\n\n**1.**      **Lesson Plan**\n\n(1)   Students will work in a small group to write a lesson plan that covers **four class periods** for the first micro-teaching (junior high school English class) and **five class periods** for the second micro-teaching (senior high school English class). The lesson plan must be formatted according to the sample lesson plans provided in this class.\n\n(2)   Before each micro-teaching session, the teaching group must turn in their lesson plan to the instructor **at least two weeks before** their teaching demonstration. After the instructor reads the lesson plan, he will discuss it with the teaching group **one week before** the micro-teaching session.\n\n(3)   After discussing with the instructor, the teaching group needs to revise their lesson plan and submit a revision to the instructor **on the day of micro-teaching, before they start to teach**.\n\n**2.**      **Micro-teaching**\n\n(1)   The teaching group needs to prepare teaching materials and distribute them to their classmates for their micro-teaching.\n\n(2)   We will discuss the allotted time for an individual micro-teaching session in the first class meeting.\n\n(3)   The teaching group will be assisted by a video-taping group (i.e., the **next** teaching group) on the day of micro-teaching. The video-taping group needs to borrow a camcorder from the English Department and set it up before the micro-teaching starts (Please contact the department office to reserve a camcorder in advance). On the day of micro-teaching, they need to time and video-tape the teaching group’s teaching demonstration.\n\n(4)   On the day of micro-teaching, students who are not in the teaching group or the video-taping group will act as students and provide comments and suggestions for the teaching group.\n\n(5)   After the micro-teaching session is completed, the instructor will lead a discussion session to help the teaching group improve their teaching knowledge and skills.\n\n(6)   After the micro-teaching session, each student in the teaching group needs to watch his/her own teaching demonstration and write an individual reflection report (no less than two pages), which is due **within two weeks**.",
