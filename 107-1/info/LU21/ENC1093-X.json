    "description": "This course first provides students general views to the history of modern continental philosophy since late 17th century covering philosophy of mind, moral and political philosophy, philosophy of existence and social theory. Through reading the original works by representative philosophers like Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, Marcus, Lacan, Foucault and Baudrillard, students will be trained to ask and think the philosophical questions essential to their literary, cultural studies and, more fundamentally, their ethical responsibility of being human subjects. How knowledge is ascertained, what it means to be an ethical subject that obeys a priori moral laws, whether happiness should be calculated and set up as the main moral goal, how the power struggle between the strong and the weak is disguised in the ideas of good and evil are formed, in what process the ego is formed in relation to the other, and so on---all these issues will be discussed in this course.",
