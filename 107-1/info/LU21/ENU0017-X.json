    "description": "This course introduces the linguistic and cultural development of the English language from its beginnings to the present. Course contents focus on the changes that have happened to the linguistic systems of English such as the sound system, vocabulary, and syntax/grammar. In addition, the background under which the changes occurred and the cultural development of the English speaking people will also be discussed. It is hoped that through the introduction and discussion of this course, students will have a better understanding about the nature of language, and further develop a correct attitude toward language change and language variation.",
