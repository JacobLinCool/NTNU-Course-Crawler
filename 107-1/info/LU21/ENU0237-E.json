    "description": "This two-semester course is to help students develop their ability to properly express themselves in written English. In the first semester, students are expected to acquire the fundamentals of English paragraph-writing, including structure (topic sentence, controlling idea, support and conclusion), outline, organization and coherence. In the second semester, students will extend their one-paragraph writing skills to three-paragraph short-essay writing. In addition, this course aims to equip students with analytic writing competence in response to different scenarios. In particular, course assignments will cover intensive writing practices in different modes, including description, narration, process, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, definition, and classification.",
