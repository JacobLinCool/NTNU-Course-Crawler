    "description": "English is viewed as an international language, but the variety of English taught to students in many EFL contexts tends to be the one spoken by native speakers from either the UK or the US. As Graddol has noted, there are more non-native speakers of English who use English for communication than there are native speakers of English. Thus it is important for students at NTNU to be aware of current trends concerning English use around the world. Such an awareness will better equip students to confront the challenges of how English is used today, and explore its impact on English teaching and learning. Topics to be covered in the course include: Kachru’s “Three Circles of English,” key concepts associated with an English-as-a- lingua-franca perspective, different varieties of English, and the impact of the globalization of English on teaching, materials development, and testing. The course will be conducted through a combination of reading, discussion, and project-based learning. Students will be expected to prepare the readings that will be discussed in each class session.",
