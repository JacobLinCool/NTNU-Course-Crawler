    "description": "The purpose of this two-semester course is to introduce students to a sample of writing in English from the Medieval period up to the eighteenth century. This semester we shall be studying literature from the time of Chaucer to the early seventeenth century. The ideas or themes we shall be considering include: gender, sexuality, political and familial bonds, voice and vision, religion, mutability and flattery.  Historical context is provided in the seminars but students will need to be doing their own background reading if they are to be successful in their work. Students are advised to bring English-Chinese dictionaries to class and to keep a notebook in which to add new vocabulary.",

    "syllabus": "**Course Description and Objectives:**\n\nThis yearlong survey course aims to broaden students’ knowledge and to form a working outline of English literary history, with the second semester covering from the Renaissance to the early 18th Century. The reading mainly focuses on the canonical authors who represent important literary and cultural concerns of their time, and the assignments span genres including romance, epic, ballad, poetry, drama, critical essay and film. Perspectives from historical contexts and literary/critical theory would be brought into the reading as a vehicle for further delving into the core significance of the literary works.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1.  Grading policy: ¨Attendance & participation 10%  ¨Group presentation 20%  ¨Exams 70%\n2.  Punctuality in coming to the class and turning in your homework is strongly desired. Exceptions are allowed only under emergent circumstances or notification in advance.\n3.  Students will hand in their homework only in electronic text on Moodle. No late homework would be accepted.\n4.
