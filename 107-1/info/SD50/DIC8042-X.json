    "description": "Population genetics is a discipline of genetics that studies the mechanism of gene frequency changes through time in a population and among populations.  It is the fundamental basis of biological evolution. It also has been widely applied to the fields of medicine and agriculture. This course aims to introduce basic concepts of population genetics from causes of gene frequency changes to molecular evolution. Key topics in evolution will also be covered. This course should provide a solid base for other special topics in evolutionary biology and conservation, such as conservation genetics, molecular evolution, and evolutionary genomics.",
