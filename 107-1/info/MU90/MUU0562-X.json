    "description": "This is a one-year elementary course of the Italian language, lasting through two semesters. The first semester starts from pronunciation and the most basic grammar (gender and number of names); then it proceeds to the conjugation of verbs. Together with the grammar rules, students learn some three hundred words, and also practice basic conversation. Students are often encouraged to make use of the Internet to improve their language skills, both by perusing Italian sites and exploring things Italian (tourist places, monuments, food, festivals, etc.), and by visiting Italian language courses in the Internet. By the end of the semester, students are expected to read Italian texts correctly, to express greetings and other basic conversation, and to formulate simple sentences in a correct way.",
