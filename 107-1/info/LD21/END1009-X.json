    "syllabus": "Course description: American critic and feminist Elaine Showalter believes that by investigating the development of campus novels, one can discern the reasons why the higher education of British and American academia has degenerated from being the “Ivory Tower” of the 1950s, to the “Tenured Tower” in the 90s, and would end up being a “Tragic Tower” in the 21st century. The publication of British campus novels has preceded America’s, but this genre did not grow in stature with defined literary characteristics until the 1950s with the popularity of campus novels in America. Most campus novels are identified with jesting and humor, but at the same time feature candid piercing criticism at the flamboyant arrogance and exploitative rivalry of the academics. This seminar will study campus novels, esp. those by professor novelists, so as to contemplate on the relationship between the evolution of campus novels and their social contexts, problems of academic ethics, roles that ethnicity and gender play in campus novels, dialogues the professor-novelists generate with their scholarly criticism and creative writing, etc. Grading policy: 1.Moodle writing assignments 25% (Moodle: http://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw) 2.In-class discussion and presentation 25% 3.Term paper 50% Primary Texts: David Lodge: Changing Places (1975), Small World (1984), Nice Work (1988) Philip Roth: The Breast (1972), The Professor of Desire (1977), The Dying Animal (2001) Amanda Cross (Carolyn Heilbrun): Death in a Tenured Position (1981), Writing a Woman's Life (1988), The Collected Stories (1997) Elaine Showalter: Faculty Towers (2005) Schedule: WeekDateContents 109/11Introduction to campus novels 209/18Changing Places 309/25Changing Places 410/02Small World 510/09Small World 610/16Nice Work 710/23Nice Work 810/30The Breast 911/06The Professor of Desire 1011/13The Dying Animal 1111/20Paper presentation 1211/27Death in a Tenured Position 1312/04Writing a Woman's Life 1412/11The Collected Stories 1512/18Faculty Towers 1612/25Paper presentation 1701/01New Year, no class. 1801/08 Term Paper due",
