    "description": "This course offers a survey of the history of science fiction literature, from its nineteenth-century precursors to the present. The genre opens important conversations about what it means to be human in a changing world. In this course we pay attention to the various mutations of the genre, from speculative fiction to escapist space operas, as well as cyberpunk, feminist sci-fi and International variations of the genre. Readings include SF (or pre-SF) short stories and novels by leading lights in the field, starting with the gothic and horror writers of the 19th century and H G Wells, and moving through Lovecraft, Herbert, Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, Stanislav Lem, William Gibson, Joanna Russ, Ursula K LeGuin, and Octavia Butler.",
    "goals": [
        "Students will develop more sophisticated language skills to read widely and deeply in target language and employ these skills for cross-cultural understanding and improved communication. Students will enter a scholarly conversation about the deﬁnitions, evolution, and purpose of the science-ﬁction genre.",
        "In engaging with literary and critical texts from different periods, students will have a deeper understanding of cultural, historical and literary contexts and gain a broad understanding of the history of English-language science ﬁction literature since 1890 in terms of its diverse forms, themes, and publication media."
