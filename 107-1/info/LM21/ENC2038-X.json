    "description": "Studies in Syntax is designed as an introduction to contemporary work in syntactic theory.\nThe framework that we will be discussing in class is Chomsky's Minimalist Program. By the\nend of the course, students should be able to understand the main ideas behind the theory\n(especially with respect to how it differs from its predecessor - Government & Binding) and\nalso to read and analyze Minimalist articles critically.\nThe course is designed as a mixture of lectures, student presentations, and in-class\ndiscussions. Please do the readings in a timely manner in order to be able to follow and\nparticipate in these discussions.\nA term paper/squib (8-10 pages, double-spaced) is due at the end of the semester.\nStudents have to choose one or more papers in consultation with the teacher and provide a\ncritical summary, ideally also presenting original data that supports or provides evidence\nagainst the analysis in the article.",
