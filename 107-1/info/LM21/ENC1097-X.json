    "description": "In this course we will take “race” as a key trope in cultural representations and study the emergence, development, and complications of “racism” through human histories and cultural encounters. Important questions include: To what extent are racial differences “real” and in what way are they socio-historically constructed? Is the emergence of modern racism inevitable or contingent? How has racial categorizations invented, consolidated, and transformed alongside the development of modern science, nationalism, imperialism, colonization, democracy and capitalism? How has white supremacy been enacted and sustained? How has the rise of “yellow,” “brown,” and mix-colored groups complicated the black-white racial bipolarity? Is color-blindness a way to dissolve racism? Have we entered a post-racial era (or, is a post-racial era possible)? Most importantly, with what strategies could literature and cultural discourses intervene, complicate, reinforce or challenge existing forms of racialization? Among our readings are theories on race produced out of Europe, North America, and trans-Pacific cultural flows respectively. We will also study specific cultural and literary cases that foreground racial issues mostly specifically in the multicultural contexts of the US and the East Asia. Before the end of the semester, we will shift our focus to the recent development in genome mapping and biotechnology and explore scientific studies’ attention to the physical materiality of race.",
