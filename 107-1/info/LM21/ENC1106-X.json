    "description": "Western societies never fall short of testimonies, reports, and diagnoses of demonic possession, not even in the time of modernity and the Enlightenment as allegedly characterized with rational mindset and aversion to regressive, pathological superstitions. Exorcism, on the other hand, aims to heal the moral-spiritual maladies and lapses engendered by demonic possession and to rebuild the secular and ecclesiastical community; to a great extent, nevertheless, exorcism as healing contributes to biopolitical administration. The possessed, as the battleground of the demonic and the holy-divine, embodies a life at the threshold in the sense that materialization and spiritualization, sacred and abject, innocent and sinful, passive and aggressive, human and nonhuman, life and death all come into a zone of indistinction. To explore the entanglement of the three sectors at issue---that is, the demonic possessor, the exorcist, and the possessed---this project aims to build up a multidisciplinary framework covering the field of religion, theology, anthropology, medicine, psychoanalysis and biopolitical discourse. This course is divided into three parts. The historical survey in the first part takes as its research objects a wide range of canonical texts such as The New Testament, Saint Augustine’s Confessions, Thomas Aquinas’s The Summa Theology and some treatises, reports or handbooks that regulate the practices of exorcism. The main concerns here lie in how demonology works as a tool for and rationalizes exorcism with a view to social-cultural representations, structures of feelings or collective symptoms. Meanwhile, this historical survey also explores how the demonic turns out to be the uncanny double of the sacred, an essential of Christian cosmological view, and plays a substantial but repressed role in the construction of identity and religious, social order. The second part of this course is concerned with psychoanalysis and medical anthropology to explore possession and exorcism as socially, culturally specific embodied self-process and look into the ambivalent transferential relation between the exorcist and the demonic-possessed and the part that exorcism qua healing plays in social control and biopolitical administration. Meanwhile, Agamben’s work will be of great help for a more sophisticated view on the paradoxes of inclusion and exclusion, sacred and abject, sovereign and homo sacer, all of which characterize the possessed’s life at the threshold. Based on the historical survey and theoretical framework as stated above, the last part of this course focuses on some popular cultural representations of demonic possession and exorcism---for example, the filmic adaptations of Anneliese Michel’s case, The Exorcist series and others---to envision a horizon beyond the reductively negative critique of popular culture.",
