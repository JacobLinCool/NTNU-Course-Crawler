    "description": "This course aims to provide an in-depth inquiry into the development of ecocriticism in the west and in Taiwan. In conjunction with eco-conferences held locally (Taipei and Taichung,) it tries to integrate the topical units with the conference topics and thus create an immediate context for scholarly engagements. Divided into 6 topical units—“Overview: Four Waves of Ecocriticism,” “War and Environment,” “the Anthropocene,” “Urban Nature,” “Animal Studies,” and “Plant Studies”—it concerns the pluriform eco-discourses in which we’d examine the close relationship between literature and environment. We’ll read five novels (Woolf, Herzog, Coetzee, Han, and Wu) and a selection of short stories and poems (Dickinson, Wordsworth, Bishop, and Atwood) to reflect upon the course of eco-literary entanglements since the late 19th century. Taken together, it aspires to disclose and unsettle the environmental unconscious in literary imagination.",
    "goals": [
        "This course aims to give students an in-depth understanding and examination of ecocriticism. Tracing its roots to Christian theology, ecocriticism has become one of the most productive and provocative discourses in contemporary theories.",
        "The course aims to introduce students to the major issues and polemics in ecocriticism, including the historical overview, discursive inceptions, environmental imagination, deep ecology, postcolonial ecology, animal ethics, eco-cosmopolitanism and the materialist turn in ecocriticism."
