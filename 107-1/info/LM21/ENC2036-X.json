    "description": "This course aims to introduce theories and practices of Corpus Linguistics as a scientific discipline of its own. Corpus Linguistics has now been considered an interdisciplinary subject, requiring knowledge of linguistic theories, quantitative statistics and data processing. Therefore, this course will provide not only the necessary theoretical foundation but also practical computational skills for students who are interested in conducting corpus-based linguistic research or language-related research. This course is extremely hands-on and will lead the students through classic examples of these corpus-based applications via in-class theme-based tutorial sessions. Unlike most of the corpus linguistic courses offered in other universities, we do not introduce you to ready-made applications or software packages (e.g., Wordsmith, AntConc, Sketch Engine, LancBox, etc.). We hope to point you to the power of coding in computational text analytics. By the end of this course, students should be expected to have achieved the necessary computational proficiency and be able to perform comparable corpus-based analyses on their own data or research questions. In particular, the weekly tutorials will stress the issues of computational text analytics (e.g., web crawling, regular expression, tokenization, segmentation, concordances, collocations, keyword analysis) and statistical processing (e.g., parametric statistical analyses) via hands-on implementation with the language. This course will be a prerequisite for more advanced courses such as ENC2045 Computational Linguistics and ENC2056 Topics on Quantitative Corpus Linguistics.",

Corpus Linguistics has now been considered an interdisciplinary subject, requiring knowledge of linguistic theories, quantitative statistics and data processing. Therefore, this course aims to provide the necessary _foundation_ as well as _skills_ for students who are interested in conducting corpus-based linguistic research or language-related research. Students are expected to learn:\n\n*   the methodological foundations of Corpus Linguistics\n*   the theoretical bases of Corpus Linguistics\n*   the technical designs and configuration of standard corpora\n*   how to adopt corpus linguistics as a scientific method in terms of :\n    *   operationalization\n    *   data retrieval\n    *   quantifying research questions\n    *   significance testing\n*   the applications of corpus-linguistic methodology in the sub-disciplines of linguistic studies\n\nThe objective of this course is two-fold. On the one hand, it will introduce the theoretical constructs behind corpus linguistics as well as the theoretical foundations that motivate such an empirical method. On the other hand, it will provide specific hands-on tutorials to equip students with the necessary skills of text and statistical processing. This course will be a prerequisite for more advanced courses such as Computational Linguistics, Quantitative Corpus Linguistics.\n\n**Grading Policies**\n\n*   Class Participation & Assignments: 30%\n*   In-class Presentations: 30%\n*   Final Research Proposal: 40%\n\n**Research** **Proposals (Max. 4 pages)**\n\nStudents are expected to follow the schedule for research proposal:\n\n*   Research Proposal (Week 1-5)\n*   Research Question, Hypothesis, and Methodology (Week 7)\n*   Progress Report and Annotated Bibliography (Week 12)\n*   Research Proposal Presentation (Week 17)\n*   Research Proposal in Print (End of Semester)",
