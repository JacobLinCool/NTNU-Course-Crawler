    "description": "As a pervasive reality, part of people’s daily life and an essential component of what it means to be human, food has a massive cultural dimension; to put it even better, food can be in fact easily equated with human culture, its study thereby being able to potentially reveal countless aspects of human cultural life. The course balances theoretical approaches with descriptive excursions on specific topics (Food and the arts, Food and popular culture, etc.), with a focus on Europe.",
    "goals": [
        "to familiarize students with the complex anthropological and sociological framework which characterizes contemporary food studies",
        "to develop the students’ ability to consider food as a cultural phenomenon with countless social and personal dimensions",
