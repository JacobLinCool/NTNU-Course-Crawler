    "syllabus": "E-learning offers a great deal of promise to learners, yet e-learning must be implemented appropriately. This graduate level course for doctoral students will explore the theoretical foundation and rationale for the successful integration of e-learning into a variety of formal and informal learning environments and address the many factors that need to be considered in the design and delivery of e-learning.\n\nThe following topics will be covered:\n\n*   Definition: What is e-learning?\n*   The growth and evolution of e-learning\n*   Learning theory: Behaviorist, cognitivist and constructivist approaches\n*   Learning theory: Connectivist approach\n*   Designing e-learning content and practice\n*   Methods of delivering e-learning\n*   Methods of assessing e-learning\n*   Evaluation techniques in e-Learning\n*   Use of mobile devices for e-learning\n*   Emerging trends in e-learnin\n\nThe coursework will involve reading and critiquing research papers each week, as well as leading 1-2 discussions of research papers. There will be a required project for those students taking this course, and the scope and focus of the project will vary, depending on the interests and backgrounds of the students. The students will learn about and practice research skills, such as writing a technical paper, critically reading research papers, and giving a technical presentation.",
