    "description": "This course highlights the interaction between urban space and the representations of urban specificities in the context of postmodern/postcolonial discourses.  It is designed to help students better understand such concepts as the city, space, and the flâneur. It is hoped that through a perusal of critical theories and in-depth textual practice, students have a thorough grasp of important issues in urban studies.\n     The course organization will include three interrelated parts.  First, we will begin with perusing critical discourses concerning the concept of the city, the configuration of space in the city, and the role the flâneur plays in the formation of urban landscape.  Secondly, the course will include a theoretical application of the above discourses to several novels and films.  We will discuss the relations among urban narratives, cultural production, and representation.  It is hoped that through a training of dialectical thinking, students can understand how the representations of urban lives and cultural production reflect off the heterogeneous spaces overlooked as well as how the urban representation provides a site of ideological wrestling.  Thirdly, students are also required to study a set of significant key terms often encountered in urban studies.  Equipped with a sound knowledge of urban studies, students are expected to synthesize the three parts and explore the interaction between urban narratives and contemporary cultural products.",
