    "description": "Oral History was rediscovered during the 1970s as a historical method that could not only supplement the master narratives of Social History which were mainly based on structures and processes. Over time, its emphasis on experiences of ordinary people, individual agency and subjectivity helped develop it into a research field within its own right. This seminar will map out the empirical and epistemological results of this development. The course will be taught in English!\n\n七〇年代重新發現了口述歷史作為歷史研究方法的價值。面對偏重結構與進展之社會史的大敘事，口述歷史不僅能作為補充，更進一步強調一般人的經驗、個人力量及主體性，這些面向逐漸讓口述歷史發展為一個獨立的研究領域。本課程將描述這個發展在經驗論與認識論層次的成果與意義。本課程以英文授課。",
