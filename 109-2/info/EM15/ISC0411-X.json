Learners evaluate the content and technical aspects of existing informational, instructional, and promotional websites designed for libraries and other organizations. Issues such as web findability, web usability, the concept of user-centered design, and card sorting will be discussed. Finally, students design a plan for managing, sustaining, and/or expanding their website. This course will expand your thinking about the integral role of information architecture in libraries and schools. At the end of this course, you will be able to understand basic principles of web usability and accessibility, understand how to organize and present digital information on the web.",
