    "description": "Given that tourism worldwide is a huge economic sector, this course poses the overarching question: what are the effects of tourism on sustainable development? Sustainable tourism is needed as increasing flows of tourists and investments in tourism have both positive and negative impacts on both local and global scales. The course will be specifically useful to students interested in understanding the types and impacts of tourism from a sustainability perspective. Lectures, a field trip, and student-led tutorials will be used to understand how tourism affects landscapes, environments and societies as a whole. This course allows students to appreciate geographers’ contributions to sustainable tourism management studies. Students will be able to approach various facets of sustainable tourism, including: ecotourism; urban tourism; community-based tourism; tourism planning, management and policy; and the future of sustainable tourism. A multifaceted understanding of tourism allows students to critically evaluate and apprehend tourism policies and activities on economic, social, and environmental domains.",

        "Analyze and apprehend the positive and negative impacts of tourism on the landscape, environment and society as a whole.",
