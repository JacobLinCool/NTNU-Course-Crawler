    "description": "Landscape ecology addresses interaction between spatial pattern and ecological process. Landscape ecology evolved from European traditions of regional geography in combination with vegetation science. The development of landscape ecology is greatly inspired by the quick advances of aerial photography and satellite imagery (both are specialties of geographers). Consequently, it incorporates the spatial prospective of geography and functional perspective of ecology. In this course, I will focus on 1) the spatial relationships among landscape elements, 2) the flows of energy, mineral nutrients, and species among the elements, and 3) the ecological dynamics of the landscape mosaic through time. My ultimate goal for this class is to provide you enough knowledge to read scientific papers and reports, and to invoke your interest in landscape ecology.",
