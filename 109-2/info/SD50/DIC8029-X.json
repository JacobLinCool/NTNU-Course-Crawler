    "description": "The course material is designed to be interdisciplinary, integrating biology, ecology, mathematics and environmental sciences. While the main course material is based on classic ecological modeling textbooks and articles, these analytic methods are applicable to multi-faceted research questions. The material builds from a single population and then extends to the ecosystem level, including species interaction, climate changes and disease as well as molecules interactions within cells. Regular modeling exercises are required (1 unit as practice). After equipped with modeling skills, students have to develop their own research questions and use modeling and data mining approaches to solve their questions. Instructors will guide students through the question-solving processes.  Students will carry out modeling and data analysis exercises on a regular basis. Students need to make presentations of their homework. We will also teach the presentation skills. Finally, students will develop their own models and applications. For the final project, students need to first prepare and discuss their proposals with the instructors. Through the discussing processes students will develop constructive and logical thinking.",
