    "description": "This course aims to offer a chronological review of the history of European cinema in its relationship to tourism and travel. By embedding cinematic discourse against the larger background of modern European history, we will be able to further understand the conflicting dynamics at work in the constant identity negotiations of the European cultures in modernity, as well as investigate more deeply the many changes in the contexts of European travel and tourism since the 1890s until today.",
    "goals": [
        "-to explore issues related to the making of the modern European identity through the medium of cinema",
        "-to understand cinema as a modern/post-modern medium and its significance in fashioning European cultures in the last 120 years",
        "-to explore travel forms, practices, locales, etc. as products of cinematic strategies",
        "-to explore the politics of national and transnational cinema and its role in the making of the European identity"
