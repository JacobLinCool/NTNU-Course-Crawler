    "description": "This one-semester course focuses on individual differences (IDs) in second language acquisition. The purpose of the course is to help students get familiar with SLA literature on ID factors and develop a feasible and meaningful research project that focuses on ID factors. In addition to a general introduction to the ID research, more emphasis will be placed on such learner variables as language aptitude, motivation, leaning styles, learning strategies, and language anxiety. Students are required to summarize and lead class discussion on assigned or self-chosen readings, develop a research proposal, and write various responses.",
