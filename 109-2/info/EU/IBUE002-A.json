    "description": "This course guides students to investigate different assessment strategies and put into practice. This course is mainly composed of two parts. Sessions 1-8 are designed to construct students understanding of classic assessment theories, while session 9-18 develops students’ competence in designing performance-based assessments and criteria-related assessments. Students are guided to understand the mutually supportive relationships of learning and assessment (learning tasks, rubrics, constructive feedbacks). IB educators who take this course need to explore the alignment of learning and assessment in MYP/DP, be familiar with criterion-related assessment, and construct a concept-driven internal assessment.",
