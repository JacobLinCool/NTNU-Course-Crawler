    "description": "The 21st century has seem the influence of the War of Terror, the financial tsunami, the 311 tsunami, the mushrooming of diverse family, the blasting of FB, twitter, LINE, the smart-phone revolution, the Sunflower Revolution, the rise of China, etc. In the age of post-revolution, a review of our everyday life and its embedded cultural politics would help us re-examine our assumptions and compel us to seek alternative framework that would re-define our self-identity and relation to others. \n\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with a reasonably compact introduction to the study of everyday life (a.k.a. popular culture) as it is problematized in critical theory and in literary work. A selected number of literary and theoretical texts will be read and discussed to give students a theoretical understanding, as well as a literary appreciation, of everyday life. With emphasis on everyday life, this course hopes to map the theoretical and literary landscapes of the contemporary world for students to be oriented toward a conceptualization of the cultural politics of everyday life. \n\nThree novels will be read back-to-back. Ed Lin, Ghost Month (2014); Tao Lin, Taipei (2013); and J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye (1951). The texts are chosen to firstly indulge students in the joy of literature and secondly to relate the geo-cultural politics of everyday life in Taiwan to the rest of the world. Students are required to follow the weekly reading schedule and make presentations about the assigned reading. The oral presentations will include the following components: 1) a plot summary; 2) an analysis of everyday life as being presented in the text; 3) related films/videos/clips from YouTube, etc. 4) a list of questions for class discussion; and 5) a written version of the presentation that the distribution of work, the list all bibliographies, and personal reflections (each member); the written report is due one week after the oral presentation. The oral presentation will take up about 30 minutes and should be supplemented with PPT, film, and all relevant audio-visual resources whenever relevant and helpful. I’d highly encourage students to design the group presentation as a “high fashion show” by incorporating all audio-visual materials to entertain fellow students and mobilize thought-provocative questions for debate and discussions in class.   \n\nWeekly theoretical conceptualizations will be done by the instructor in the way of lecture and quizzes. Basically, twelve sets of binary construct (e.g., man vs. woman; life vs. death, etc.) will be highlighted in order to introduce students to key concerns of the study of everyday life. The textbook is John Storey’s Cultural Studies and the Study of Popular Culture (2003). Weekly the instructor will present a lecture to introduce students to the history, schools of thoughts, and keywords about the study of everyday life. Major concerns include the history of the study of popular culture as a field of enquiry; the distinction between popular culture/mass culture and high culture; Marxist critique of mass capitalism; Althusser’s theory of ideology, Gramsci’s notion of hegemony; the relationship between America and popular culture; the Frankfurt School’s theory of commodity fetishism, cultural industry, modern capitalism; and the rise of postmodernism and its impact to everyday life in the contemporary world.",

The selected topics and readings are meant to help them develop an extensive and also in-depth view of popular culture and everyday life. With emphasis on enhancing students’ ability in critical thinking and analytical reading of popular literature and culture, this course will focus on the study of cultural theory and critical monographs on popular culture so as to shape a conceptual outline of popular culture and foster a critical perspective for the contested social, historical, and political dimensions embedded in popular culture, as well as the psychological complexity underlying the empirical forms of everyday life.\n\n**II.
