    "syllabus": "**Course description**\n\nThis course is to help students develop their knowledge of particular writing genres and apply it to real-world situations. They will be particularly taught to (1) analyze photos, (2) create a travel brochure, and (3) make a proposal. In addition, they will learn to build up their writing style through some online editing tools. It is intended that students can hone their writing skills and techniques through lectures, hands-on practices, writing drafts, peer review, individual conferencing with the professor, and major revisions.\n\nFor details, please check out the [syllabus](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=2ed2ed7bf7f440119e84fcd29135268e&fno=57aab91665d74268b8979591cf38ca15).",
