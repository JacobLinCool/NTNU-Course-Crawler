    "syllabus": "ADVANCED LISTENING—Spring Semester 2021\n\n**Tuesdays, 8:10—10:00, Lab 701A;  Thursdays, 8:10—10:00, Lab 701A**                    \n\n**Instructor:**  Jean E. Curran, Office: 誠714\n\n**Office Hours:** Mondays, 16:00 – 18:00; Tuesdays, 10:00 – 12:00      \n\n**Email: curran.jean@gmail.com**\n\n**Goals**\n=========\n\nThis is the second semester of a year-long course. During this semester we will continue to build upon the skills discussed and practiced last semester.  These skills include predicting, listening for the main idea, listening for details, critical listening, and vocabulary development. The organization of the course and the materials used will be similar to last semester.\n\n**Materials**\n\nPreiss, Sherry. (2015). _North Star Listening and Speaking, Level 5_ (Fourth Edition). White Plains, NY: Pearson Education.\n\n**Requirements**\n================\n\n**1.  Attendance and Preparation**: This is a skill-based course. It is expected that you will attend class weekly to practice your listening skills. If you miss class frequently, points will be deducted from your final grade for the course. Please arrive for class on time.  If you are late on a regular basis, points will be deducted from your final grade for the course. If it is necessary for you to be late, please enter the classroom quietly. Prior to class, please prepare the readings and vocabulary that accompany the chapters in the textbook.\n\n**2.  Participation**: Although this class focuses on the development of listening skills, it is also expected that you will be an active participant in the learning process.  You should be a critical listener, and contribute to any classroom discussions of the listening topics.\n\n**3.  Listening—Outside the Classroom**: There are options this semester concerning homework. These will be discussed on the first day of class. After you review this information, and plan your schedule for the semester, you will complete a listening contract. It is your responsibility to follow the guidelines you have set up in your listening contract.\n\n**4.**   **Listening to a Longer Program**: Everyone is required to listen to one program from _BBC World Debate_ series. After listening to the program, you are asked to write a summary and reflection of this program, and a reflection on listening to a program of this nature. Alternatively, you may submit your notes from this listening task. In addition to listing your name and student number on your report, please list the title of the program that you chose and the link to the program.\n\n       These programs are presented in a format where several people are invited to comment, thus it is good practice in listening to a number of speakers as they try to present their points of view. Some have a video component, while others are only available in an audio format. You may choose the format you prefer. The audience is allowed to comment in some episodes, and you may also find a variety of Englishes. The programs are approximately 50 minutes long. Thus you should plan your time accordingly.\n\n**5.  A Favorite Source for Your Journals**: Each student will be asked to introduce a source of listening materials to our class and explain (briefly) why you like this particular source. Each person will have **5 minutes** to talk about the source. Each student MUST choose a different source, and you may NOT use a source from the list I gave you in the first semester. \n\n**Grading**\n\nYour final grade will be based on your scores on the midterm and final exams, your journals, attendance, presentation, and participation.\n\n**Advanced Listening—Syllabus—Spring Semester 2021—TUESDAY**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n                                     **Topic**\n\nHomework Date Due\n\n1\n\nFebruary 23\n\n### Orientation to the Second Semester of the Course\n\n**North Star—Unit 5**: “Business Not as Usual”\n\n2\n\nMarch 2\n\n**North Star—Unit 5**: “Business Not as Usual”\n\n3\n\nMarch 9\n\n**North Star—Unit 5**: “Business Not as Usual”\n\nJournal 1\n\n4\n\nMarch 16\n\nListening to Academic Lectures\n\nNotetaking Skills\n\n5\n\nMarch 23\n\n**North Star—Unit 6**: “Together Alone”\n\n6\n\nMarch 30\n\n**North Star—Unit 6**: “Together Alone”\n\n7\n\nApril 6\n\nHoliday—Spring Vacation\n\n8\n\nApril 13\n\nListening to Academic Lectures\n\n### Notetaking Skills\n\n9\n\nApril 20\n\n**MIDTERM EXAM**\n\n10\n\nApril 27\n\nMOVIE\n\n**\\* Last** **Day to Submit First Half of Journals**\n\n11\n\nMay 4\n\nReview Answers to Take-Home Assignment for\n\n “Warriors Without Weapons” & “Spiritual Renewal”\n\n12\n\nMay 11\n\n**North Star—Unit 7:** “Learning Through the Arts”\n\n13\n\nMay 18\n\n**North Star—Unit 7:** “Learning Through the Arts”\n\n14\n\nMay 25\n\n**North Star—Unit 8:**\n\n“Microfinance: Changing Lives for $50”\n\n15\n\nJune 1\n\n**North Star—Unit 8:**\n\n“Microfinance: Changing Lives for $50”\n\n**\\*_BBC World Debate_ Assignment Due**\n\n16\n\nJune 8\n\n**FINAL EXAM**\n\n**\\* Last** **Day to Submit Second Half of Journals**\n\n**\\* Summary List of Journals Due**\n\n17\n\nJune 15\n\n**Take-Home Assignment:** \n\n“Warriors Without Weapons”\n\n18\n\nJune 22\n\n**Take-Home Assignment:** \n\n“Spiritual Renewal”\n\n_Jean E.
