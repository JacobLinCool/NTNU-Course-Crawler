This course will begin with the exploration of how gender order and expectations is mediated through language. That is, how does our everyday use of language carry gender expectations and shape (or reinforce) gender orders and stereotypes? The second theme deals with gender-differentiated language use and its relationship with other social and cultural factors. Toward the end of the semester, we will also explore the relationship between language, gender, and sexuality. Since gender is everywhere in our life, students are expected to observe gendered practice in their everyday interactions and to contribute to class discussions.\n\nRequired Readings\n=================\n\nSelected sections from the following books:\n\nGoodard, Angela., & Mean, Lindsey.
