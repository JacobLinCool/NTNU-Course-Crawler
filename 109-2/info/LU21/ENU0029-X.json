In this two-part course, students will have a chance to practice their own news gathering and writing skills in the first two weeks under the guidance of Professor Monk, a Penn State journalism teacher and professional writer. In the second half of the course, Professor Goodwin will lead students to analyze and discuss news articles taken from the International Herald Tribune and other sources, to build reading comprehension and speaking skills.",
