    "description": "This course is designed as an overview of topics pertaining to the relation between language and mind and can be considered to be an introduction to the field of psycholinguistics. It focuses on language as a phenomenon that is internal to human beings’ heads. Rather than analyzing language as a cultural, external object, it is analyzed here as a psychological, internal one. Thus, we’ll be discussing language not as you see them in textbooks but as they’re represented in the mind. Classes will be conducted in English.\nHuman beings naturally develop a system of knowledge that enables them to use language. In this course we will discuss:\n(i)\t How that system of knowledge is organized and what are its main components and properties\n(ii)\t How it is used unconsciously in real time in order to produce and comprehend linguistic expressions\n(iii)\tHow it develops in the individual from birth until puberty\n(iv)\tHow its properties are different in the case of second/foreign languages",
