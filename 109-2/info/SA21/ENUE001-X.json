Textbook evaluation: The group should find a set of textbooks for review. The review should include some background information of the textbook, including target users, target language skills (or components), main learning theories or principles, the layout/design of the lessons/units, levels of difficulty (e.g., definition, progression) and your comments.\n\n2\\. Bilingual education survey: You need to design a bilingual education open-ended survey. Then you need to invite at least 20 people to fill out the survey. After you collect the survey, you should analyze the surveys and report the results.  \n\nFinal Project:\n\nFor your final project, you have to tutor a student or a group of students for at least 4 weeks. For each of the four weeks, you will have to keep a journal of your teaching activities, your students’ progress, and your own reflection. You also need to include some background information of your students. A typical entry of the teaching journal will include: (1) Date and time of the class, (2) Lesson objectives, (3) Main teaching activities and the rationales for using these activities, (4) Students’ observed progress, (5) Students’ feedback, and (6) Your own reflection. After the four teaching sessions, you need to write an overall reflection of your own teaching and what you have learned from this process. You will present your project orally in class before it is submitted on **June 21.**",
