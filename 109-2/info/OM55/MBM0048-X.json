    "description": "The course extends financial decision-making to the international setting. Topics include the foreign exchange market, predicting exchange rate movements, hedging exposures with various derivative and other alternatives, the challenges of raising funds internationally and the process and documents of international trade. The course makes extensive use of case studies and there is an expectation that students will make recommendations to real life problems and justify their decisions. This is a challenging course with a significant theory content which requires class attendance and participation in addition to the appropriate independent study and thought to be successful. \nThe first half of the course covers the determination of foreign exchange rates, and the basics of trading in financial markets and governmental exchange rate policy.
