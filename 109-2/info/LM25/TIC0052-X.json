    "description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to Greek tragedy and to provide them with some notion of the vast influence that Greek tragedy has had on world literature. In the first half of the course, we will read tragedies by the three Greek playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In the second half of the course, we will read several plays that have been influenced either directly or indirectly by Greek tragedy. In particular, we will read plays written by Seneca, Shakespeare, Racine, Cao Yu, and Arthur Miller.",
