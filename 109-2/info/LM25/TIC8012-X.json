    "description": "An important component of translation studies involves the history of translation: how various cultures spread to other recipient cultures through translation. And one of the best ways to study this history is to trace the development of Latin: how the Romans absorbed Greek culture, how, in the Latin west, the Roman Catholic Church propagated itself through the Latin translation of the Bible, how the Latin philosophical vocabulary was passed down into the western culture tradition, and so on. \n\nThe aim of this course is to provide students with a gateway into Latin. It assumes knowledge of about half to one year’s worth of Latin. Using Keith Sidwell’s celebrated Reading Medieval Latin, we will examine and translate various Latin texts from the Middle Ages that have been influential in western cultural history. \n\nPh.D. students are expected to do considerably more work than the MA students.",
