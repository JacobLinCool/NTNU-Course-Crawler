    "description": "The course begins with an overview of social research, and of several quantitative research methods frequently used in social science research.  Next, it focuses on learning statistical concepts needed to answer specific quantitative research questions. Thereafter it focuses on survey research, including survey administration. It then reviews the elements of quantitative research design, and in the end requires the students to conduct statistical analysis of the data obtained through the methods, and to present the research findings to the class.",
