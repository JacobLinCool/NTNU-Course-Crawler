    "description": "Behavioral ecology is the study of why animals behave the way they do. It focuses on understanding how biotic and abiotic environments can interact to shape an individual’s behavior. Students will be introduced to some of the main topics in behavioral ecology. They will also be trained to propose and evaluate hypotheses about the adaptive value of animals’ behavioral decisions and to design experiments to test between these hypotheses.",
