    "description": "Hierarchical Linear Models(HLM) is an advanced methodology course. The goal of the course\nis to understand the concepts related to HLM; to be able to specify your own models and\nanalyze the data using one of the HLM related programs; to be able to interpret\nthe statistical findings to lay persons. The course emphasizes the mastery of concepts,\ndevelopment of skills in the use and interpretation of HLM software, and the development of\nanalysis skills for understanding research using multilevel models. Topics include multilevel\ndata structures, intraclass correlation, model building and testing, effect size, fixed and\nrandom effects, two and three level models, longitudinal models, model assumptions.",
