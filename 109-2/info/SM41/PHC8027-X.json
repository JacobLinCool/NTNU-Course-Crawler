It is expected that you will attend class weekly to discuss and practice the skills that are the focus of the course. If you fail to attend class, or miss class frequently, it will affect your final grade. Prior to class, please prepare any assigned readings and complete any assigned tasks.\n\n**2.  Participation**: It is expected that students will be active participants in the learning process. \n\nGrading\n\nYour final grade will be based on:\n\n1.  There are two choices: a final research paper based on your own research or a review paper based on a topic in physics you are interested in.\n2.  Three presentations. One will be from the textbook, one on a science article of interest to the general public, and the final one will relate to the research or review paper you will submit at the end of the semester.\n3.  As noted above, students are expected to attend class on a regular basis and participate in class discussion. There will be many in-class writing and speaking activities related to the textbooks and other readings, and there will also be some short take-home writing assignments.    \n\nFinal Research Paper                                                                    20%\n\nClass Presentations (textbook, article & research paper)              45%\n\nAttendance, Class Discussion, Assignments                                  35%\n\nEnglish for Academic Purposes—Speaking & Writing Skills\n\nSyllabus—Spring 2021\n\n**Week**\n\n**Date**\n\n                               **Topic**\n\n**Speaker**\n\n1\n\nFebruary 25\n\nOrientation to the Course\n\n2\n\nMarch 4\n\nIssues of Vocabulary; Paraphrasing; Academic Integrity; Avoiding Plagiarism\n\n### Alley, Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n3\n\nMarch 11\n\nPreparing Your Visual Aids\n\nGiving an Academic Presentation\n\n4\n\nMarch 18\n\n### Alley, Chapter 2, Critical Error 1\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing an Introduction\n\n5\n\nMarch 25\n\nAlley, Chapter 2, Critical Error 2\n\n### Glasman-Deal: Writing an Introduction\n\n6\n\nApril 1\n\n### Spring Holiday—NO Class\n\n7\n\nApril 8\n\nAlley, Chapter 3, Structure\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing about Methodology\n\n8\n\nApril 15\n\nAlley, Chapter 3, Critical Error 3\n\nAlley, Chapter 3, Critical Error 4\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing about Methodology\n\n\\* Midterm Exam Week\n\n9\n\nApril 22\n\nAlley, Chapter 3, Critical Error 5\n\n### Alley, Chapter 3, Critical Error 6\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing about Results\n\n10\n\nApril 29\n\n### Alley, Chapter 4, Critical Error 9\n\nAlley, Chapter 5, Delivery\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing about Results\n\n11\n\nMay 6\n\nAlley, Chapter 5, Critical Error 10\n\nAlley, Chapter 5, Critical Error 11\n\nWriting the Review Paper; Synthesizing\n\n12\n\nMay 13\n\nAlley, Chapter 5, Critical Error 12\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing the Discussion/Conclusion\n\n13\n\nMay 20\n\n### Alley, Chapter 5, Critical Error 13\n\nGlasman-Deal: Writing the Discussion/Conclusion\n\n14\n\nMay 27\n\n### Glasman-Deal: Writing the Abstract\n\n15\n\nJune 3\n\n### Final Presentations\n\n16\n\nJune 10\n\n### Final Presentations   \\* Final Exam Week\n\n17\n\nJune 17\n\nTake-home Assignment: Final Paper\n\n18\n\nJune 24\n\nTake-home Assignment: Final Paper\n\n**\\*Final Paper Due**\n\nEnglish for Academic Purposes—Speaking & Writing Skills, Spring 2021                    curran.jean@gmail.com",
