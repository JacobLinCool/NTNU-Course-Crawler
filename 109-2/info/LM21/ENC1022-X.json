The readings selected in this course focus on those voices or lives lesser heard. The course approaches drama from various theoretical lenses of difference, such as feminism, queer studies, critical race studies, and disability studies. The course is divided into three major sections: (1) representations of violence in documentary theatre, (2) contemporary adaptations of Euripides’s Medea in Latina/o theatre, (3) staging of non-normative bodies in freak shows. In each major section, students are invited to adopt a comparative perspective to examine paired playscripts to identify the convergence, divergence, tension, and/or extension between the readings in order to understand a topic in depth.",

The readings selected in this course focus on those voices or lives lesser heard. The course approaches drama from various theoretical lenses of difference, such as feminism, queer studies, critical race studies, and disability studies. The course is divided into three major sections: (1) representations of violence against women on stage, (2) contemporary adaptations of Euripides’s _Medea_ in Chicanx theatre, (3) staging of non-normative bodies in freak shows. In each major section, students are invited to adopt a comparative perspective to examine paired plays to identify the convergence, divergence, tension, and/or extension between the readings in order to understand a topic in depth.\n\n**Tentative Weekly Schedule:** _The instructor may make changes to the schedule before the first class._\n\n**Introduction to the course**\n\nWeek 1\n\n2/22\n\nIntroduction to the course\n\nWeek 2\n\n3/1\n\n_Holiday—No Class_\n\n**Unit 1: Body Politics, Monologues, Documentary Theatre**\n\nWeek 3\n\n3/8\n\n*   Eve Ensler’s _The Vagina Monologues_\n\nWeek 4\n\n3/15\n\n*   (watch before class) Documentary on Ciudad Juárez femicide: _Senorita Extraviada_ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFKGScB4efw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFKGScB4efw)\n*   Humberto Robles’s “Women of Sand: Testimonios of Women in Ciudad Juárez”: [https://mujeresdearenateatro.blogspot.com/p/woman-of-sand.html](https://mujeresdearenateatro.blogspot.com/p/woman-of-sand.html)\n*   Kalina Brabeck’s “Testimonio: A Strategy for Collective Resistance, Cultural Survival and Building Solidarity”\n\nWeek 5\n\n3/22\n\n**_Presentation & Discussion Facilitation 1_**\n\n3/24\n\n_Professor Guisela Latorre’s virtual talk “Public Interventions: Chicana Feminist Murals” (3/24 Wed 19:00-21:00)_\n\n**Unit 2: Medea Adaptations, Chicanx Theatre**\n\nWeek 6\n\n3/29\n\n*   Euripides’s _Medea_\n*   Luis Alfaro’s _Mojada_\n\n**_Short Essay Option 1 (The Vagina Monologues or Women of Sand) due by 14:20 on Moodle_**\n\nWeek 7\n\n4/5\n\n_Holiday—No Class_\n\nWeek 8\n\n4/12\n\n*   Gloria Anzaldúa’s _Borderlands_ Ch 1, Ch 2, Ch7\n*   Cherríe Moraga’s “Queer Aztlán: The Re-formation of Chicano Tribe”\n\nWeek 9\n\n4/19\n\n*   Cherríe Moraga’s _The Hungry Women_\n\nWeek 10\n\n4/26\n\n**_Presentation & Discussion Facilitation 2_**\n\n**Unit 3: Non-Normative Bodies, Freak Shows**\n\nWeek 11\n\n5/3\n\n*   Bernard Pomerance’s _The Elephant Man_\n\n**_Short Essay Option 2 (Mojada or The Hungry Woman) due by 14:20 on Moodle_**\n\nWeek 12\n\n5/10\n\n*   Suzan-Lori Parks’s _Venus_\n\n*   Jean Young’s “The Re-Objectification and Re-Commodification of Saartjie Baartman in Suzan-Lori Parks’s _Venus_”\n\nWeek 13\n\n5/17\n\n**_Presentation and Discussion Facilitation 3_**\n\n**Final Project**\n\nWeek 14\n\n5/24\n\nFinal project consultation and research week.
