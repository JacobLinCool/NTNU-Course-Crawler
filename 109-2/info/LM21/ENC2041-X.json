    "description": "This is a graduate-level course on the psychology of language. This course is meant to\nintroduce registered students to a selection of current issues regarding the relationship\nbetween grammar and language processing. The topics to be explored will include, thought\nnot necessarily be limited to, the following:\n The architecture of grammar and its interfaces: Competence and performance\n Grammatical categories: Nouns and verbs\n Mass/count distinctions in grammar and cognition\n Lexical access and lexical representation (e.g. semantic ambiguity)\n Relative clauses and sentence processing\n Syntax and prosody\n Disfluency in discourse (hesitations, etc.)\n Working memory\n Priming studies: Lexical and syntactic effects\n Linguistic relativity: Language and various other modalities (e.g. space, mathematics,music, causal reasoning, etc.)\n Grammar and different kinds of evidence in linguistic argumentation\n Evolution of language\nThis course is intended to stimulate creative research in psycholinguistics. You are\nencouraged to think about the questions that interest you, critically search and read relevant\nliterature, and, if possible, design experiments to test your hypotheses. I will be available to\ntalk about research ideas and how to put your ideas into empirical falsification. This course\ndoes not intend to cover all topics in psycholinguistics. You should glance over the selected\ntopics to decide if they are of interest to you. Knowledge about statistics and psychological\nexperimentation, though will be helpful, is not required.",
