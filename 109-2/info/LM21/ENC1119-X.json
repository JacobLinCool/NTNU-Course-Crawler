    "description": "This course aims to provide an in-depth inquiry into the development of ecocriticism in the west and in Taiwan. In conjunction with eco-conferences held locally (Taipei and Taichung,) it tries to integrate the topical units with the conference topics and thus create an immediate context for scholarly engagements. Divided into 6 topical units—“Overview: Four Waves of Ecocriticism,” “War and Environment,” “the Anthropocene,” “Urban Nature,” “Animal Studies,” and “Plant Studies”—it concerns the pluriform eco-discourses in which we’d examine the close relationship between literature and environment. We’ll read five novels (Woolf, Herzog, Coetzee, Han, and Wu) and a selection of short stories and poems (Dickinson, Wordsworth, Bishop, and Atwood) to reflect upon the course of eco-literary entanglements since the late 19th century. Taken together, it aspires to disclose and unsettle the environmental unconscious in literary imagination.",
    "goals": [
        "This course aims to give students an in-depth understanding and examination of ecocriticism. Tracing its roots to Christian theology, ecocriticism has become one of the most productive and provocative discourses in contemporary theories.",
        "The course aims to introduce students to the major issues and polemics in ecocriticism, including the historical overview, discursive inceptions, environmental imagination, deep ecology, postcolonial ecology, animal ethics, eco-cosmopolitanism and the materialist turn in ecocriticism."

    "syllabus": "Ecocriticism                                                                                       Prof. Iping Liang\n\nSpring 2021                                                                                     [lipntnu@gmail.com](mailto:lipntnu@gmail.com)\n\nChing 301                                                                                 Line ID: ip577816\n\nDescription\n\nSince its inception in the 1990s, ecocriticism has gone through “waves” of transformation. This course aims to provide a critical introduction to some of the recent issues. Divided into five topics—“Materialist Ecocriticism,” “Hyperobjects,” “Critical Plant Studies,” “the Anthropocene,” and “Eco Taiwan”—it is interested in the pluriform eco-discourses in which we will examine the entanglements between the humans and the non-humans. We’ll read three novels (Chang-rae Lee, Han Kang, and Jessica Lee) and a selection of critical essays to reflect upon the course of eco-literary relationships. In addition, five eco-related events are recommended for autonomous self-studies. Taken together, it aspires to disclose and unsettle the ecological/ environmental unconscious in literary imagination.            \n\nSchedule (Tentative)\n\nDates\n\nTopics\n\nAssigned Readings\n\nEco-events\n\n2/24\n\nIntroduction\n\n〈緒論: 生態文學批評的出口〉。\n\n《生態危機與文學研究》。蔡振興。書林。2019, pp. 1-29.\n\nTaipei Biennial:\n\n“You and I Don’t Live on the Same Planet!”\n\n(Closed by 3/14)\n\n03/03\n\nMaterialist Ecocriticism\n\n1\\. “Bodily Nature,” Stacy Alaimo.\n\n2\\.
