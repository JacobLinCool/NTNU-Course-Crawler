    "description": "This graduate-level course examines theory, research, and practice related to bilingualism and biliteracy development. It will explore the process of language and literacy development of children or people exposed to more than one language. In addition to theoretical scholarly work, the readings will focus on selected Chinese-bilingual, US and international cases to illustrate more general concerns relating to learners’ bilingual / bicultural / biliterate development in formal educational settings. Topics to be addressed will include, but not be limited to, emergent biliteracy, transfer theory, family literacy, individual and contextual factors, sociocultural influences, biliteracy in the classrooms. Students will also have an opportunity to conduct a mini research proposal to explore topics that they are interested in. \nRequired Readings: \nThere is no required textbook for this course. Each week students will be assigned several journal articles and/or book chapters to read that are related to the theme of the week. Except for a few electronic resources, most readings will be included in a coursepack prepared by the instructor.",
