    "description": "This course offers an introduction to the concepts and methodology of linguistic typology. It provides an overview of the similarities and differences that underlie the vast array of human languages through examining major grammatical categories and constructions in the world’s languages.\n\nThe overall goals are: to develop the skills necessary to analyze the structure of language, and to provide a general training in analytic thought. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to recognize the diversity of language systems and their fundamental similarities (i.e. universals), and to understand and use the basic terminology of linguistic typology.",
