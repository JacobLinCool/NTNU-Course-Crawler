    "description": "This course aims to develop students understanding of and critical thinking skills in Technology Enhanced Language Learning (TELL). The aim will be achieved by providing students with an introduction to the past, present and future trends of TELL. Students will engage in studying relevant theories and literature and discussing research trends in terms of the strengths and limitations of TELL. Classes will be blended; a portion of face-to-face instruction will be replaced by web-based online teaching, either synchronous or asynchronous.",
