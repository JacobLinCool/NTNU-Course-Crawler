    "description": "In contrast to first language acquisition, the end state of second language acquisition is unreliable and unconvergent. It usually relies on the interaction among first language, language universal/universal linguistic patterns, and domain-general learning properties. This course serves as an introduction to investigate each of these factors that affect second language acquisition.",
