    "syllabus": "The main goal of this course is to enhance non-English majors’ English abilities to understand and discuss educational issues through watching education-based films. In each film, students will learn English expressions and talk about the educational issues highlighted in the films. To ensure students’ learning, two projects will be conducted. While the mid-term project will engage students in illustrating educational issues through comics, the final project will engage students in talking about educational issues through mini-film production. In this way, students are expected to learn education-related English and broaden their knowledge and views about education at the same time.  \n[教學進度與主題附件](https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/NtnuFileShare/file.do?action=dl&gno=a30d4f9d95b34a8892a65c1f72292877&fno=3cbd573a290a4dbe9ba6fa237b9d545c)",
