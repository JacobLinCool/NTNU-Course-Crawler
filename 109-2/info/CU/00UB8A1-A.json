    "syllabus": "**Advanced Freshman English - Spring 2021**\n\n**Time:** Monday, 08:10-10:00                    **Classroom:** 公館 綜合館002\n\n**Objectives:** This course is designed to support college freshmen in their use of **English language in an academic context** through **intensive and extensive reading** and **skill/strategy training**. In addition, it also aims to build student proficiency in the output language skills—**writing and speaking**—through a variety of activities that integrate all four language skills. Therefore, the main objectives of this semester will be to develop students’ **(1)** **fluency in critically expressing ideas** in oral and written forms in English, **(2)** **English presentation skills**, and **(3) autonomous learning skills**. In order to do so, there is a **five-pronged approach** to the course:\n\n**1) Firstly,** the **course textbook** and **online practice website** consist of a purposefully structured skills and strategies program to **propel language learning** and **create independent learners**. Furthermore, the textbook helps improve **vocabulary learning, reading proficiency** and **develop practical critical thinking.** There will also be four **Chapter Reviews** to quiz student comprehension.\n\n**2) Secondly,** over the course of the first-half of the semester, students will undertake one major **task-based presentation project using Powerpoint,** in which task groups, of no more than 3 students per group, are asked to **investigate areas and topics** that are **of serious interest to themselves**, and then **present their work** to the class.\n\n**3) Thirdly,** students are expected to read extensively to improve their English reading, especially **Lexile books.** There will be a second **Lexile Test** to assess improvement which is expected to be 50+ points.\n\n**3) Fourthly,** students will need to do at least **_12 hours_ of** **autonomous learning (one hour a week)** in total this semester. These experiences must be **proven, catalogued and/or recorded** and handed in at the end of the semester**.**\n\n**4) Finally**, there will be extensive **writing workshops** in which students will be asked to write **two reviews and a short critical essay** based on class work\n\n**N.B: All course elements will be evaluated and assessed for final grading.**\n\n**Tentative Course Schedule** **(NB:** **This may change at the lecturer\\`s discretion.)**\n\nWk\n\nDate\n\nContent\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n2/22\n\n   **Orientation & Table Quiz**\n\nBring a book next class!\n\n2\n\n3/1\n\n   **No Class (2/28)**\n\n3\n\n3/8\n\n1.
