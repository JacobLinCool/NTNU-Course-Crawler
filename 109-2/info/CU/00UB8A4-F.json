    "syllabus": "Course Description  \nThis course aims to develop student’s English proficiency regarding all four language skills. Students  \nare expected to increase their reading and writing literacy along with listening comprehension and  \ncommunication competence through a variety of in-class and out-of-class activities.\n\n**Textbook**\n\n    Macintyre, Paul &amp; Bohlke, David. (2019). Reading Explorer: Book 2 (Third Edition). National  \nGeographic Learning.\n\nRequirements and Rules  \n1\\. Punctual attendance, lesson preparation and active participation are required. Participation  \nalso includes teamwork and group discussion.  \nAll absences will be classified as excused or unexcused.  \nAbsences for the following reasons will be excused if there is timely verification  \n(within 1 week) of such reasons provided to the instructor:  \nIllness or medical emergency  \nFamily emergencies  \nPre-arranged medical appointments.  \nPre-arranged school-sponsored activities, such as field trips.  \nA Notification of Absence Form has to be submitted online (學生請假系統) within 1  \nweek. Verification document (hard-copy) should also be handed in to the instructor  \nwithin 1 week. Late submission will not be accepted.  \nStudents who are more than 30 minutes late to class will be considered absent.  \nStudents will fail this course if there are more than 3 unexcused absences.  \nStudents will fail this course if they miss more than 5 meetings the whole semester.  \n2\\. Plagiarism and cheating on quizzes or exams is absolutely forbidden. If someone is found cheating on  \nan exam, he/she will fail that exam.  \n3\\. Textbook is a must. Violation of this rule will cost you 2 points (out of your final score) each time.  \n4\\. You cannot use your laptop or smart phone in class without the teacher’s permission. Violation of this  \nrule will cost you 2 points each time.  \n5\\. Before every meeting, you must preview the reading. Look up the words that you don’t know in the  \ndictionary and write down their meanings. Then read the paragraphs out loud. Try to get the main point  \nof each paragraph. I’ll check whether you have done all the preview tasks in class. Those who fail to do  \nwhat is required will lose one point each time.  \n6\\. The whole class will be divided into 6 groups. Each group picks one person who is competent and\n\nresponsible to be their leader. In every meeting, the leader checks his group members’ textbooks for me  \nto see if each of them has looked up the new words in the dictionary and written their meanings on the  \nbook. Then he goes over the text to see if each one understands everything. After that, some students will  \nbe randomly called to read aloud or translate the text and answer the comprehension questions. If they  \ncannot do the task well, they’ll get some assignment to do after class. Then some follow-up questions  \nwill be raised for further discussion. Each discussion session will last 15 minutes. Exchange your  \nopinions within your group and contribute your ideas. Each time the group must assign one member to  \ngive a report of their discussion and his/her report will constitute 5 points of his/her final score.  \n7\\. This semester you have to turn in an autobiography (with at least 100 words) and a written  \nreflection on the assigned Lexile reading. Print them out on an A4 paper and submit them to me  \nas scheduled.  \n8\\. A speaking activity – Show and Tell: My Favorite X -- will be held on 10/18. Share one of your  \nfavorite topics with your classmates. You can use multimedia and all kinds of resources (props,  \ncostumes, photos, etc.) to make your presentation interesting to the audience. It must be done in  \nEnglish and last at least 2 minutes. An example is given in the appendix.  \n9\\. This semester we won’t have a written midterm exam. Instead, we’ll have an oral report of a study  \nyou do about the topics discussed in class. Choose one of the topics and do some research about it.  \nThen present your study to the class. In your presentation, tell the class what motivates you to do  \nsuch a study, what is your study method, what are your major findings and what suggestions you  \ncan provide. Your report should be about 2.5 minutes long.  \n10\\. In order to improve your extensive reading skills and discussion skills, one Lexile book will be  \nassigned as an outside reading for you to practice discussing on 12/11. Before the event, the teacher  \nwill briefly introduce the essence of quality talk and the most frequently used 6 types of questions.  \nEach student must try to ask as many questions as possible, proving that they really understand how  \nto ask questions in order to elicit important information and stimulate further thoughts. They write  \ndown their questions on a paper before coming to class. In class, they take turns asking their group  \nmembers the questions. While doing the task, they work together, thinking about which questions  \nare important and inspiring enough to be included. After that, they hand in a paper with all the  \nquestions fitting the 6 categories and their answers on it. This assignment is due on 12/18 and  \nconstitutes 5 points. Then each student writes down his/her thought about the book on an A4 paper  \nand submit it to me on 12/18 too. This will constitute another 5 points.  \n11\\. At the end of the term, the leader rates his/her group members’ degree of engagement in the  \ndiscussion and their overall contribution on a 0–5 scale. In addition, in order to push the students  \nto enlarge their word bank, a vocabulary test will be held to see how many important words the  \nstudents have learned. The test result constitutes 10 points. Now that the vocabulary is singled  \nout and tested beforehand, the final exam will be intended to test only their reading ability and  \nwriting ability. Likewise, there will be a reading-aloud test in order to push the students to open  \ntheir mouths and read English out loud. Every student will be required to read aloud a paragraph  \nchosen from the readings in the textbook. Their performance in the test will constitute 5 points.  \n12\\. Check Moodle 2.8 and email frequently  \nI assume that you check your email and the course site frequently. It’s your responsibility to  \nmake sure you register with the correct email address on Moodle 2.8. Not receiving a notice is  \nNOT an excuse for any late submission. Late submission will be penalized 10% per day.\n\nGrading Policies\n\nAttendance and Participation 10%  \nShow and Tell: My Favorite X (10/23) 10%  \nVocabulary Test (1/08) 10%  \nAutobiography (10/16) &amp; Reflection on the Lexile Reading (12/18) 10%  \nReading Aloud (12/04) 5%  \nReport of the Discussion 5%  \nQuestions for the Outside Reading and Their Answers (12/18) 5%  \nPeer Evaluation (1/08 degree of involvement and contribution) 5%  \nOral Presentation of Your Study (11/13) 20%  \nFinal Exam (1/15) 20%\n\nBonus Points (for those who can’t get 60 points in the Final Exam)  \n1\\.
